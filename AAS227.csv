Although it is generally considered a great triumph, the theory's early years were characterized by conceptual confusion, empirical uncertainties and a lack of relevance to ordinary physics. But in recent decades, a remarkably diverse set of precision experiments has established it as the ""standard model"" for gravitational physics. Yet it might not be the final word. We review a century of measurements that have verified general relativity, and describe some of the opportunities and challenges involved in testing Einstein’s great theory in strong-field regimes and in gravitational waves.\n",1,

Sheehan*,W. Sheehan*,Sessioned,Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health Services,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The discovery of the outer planet Neptune in 1846, based on the calculated position published by Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier, has been hailed as the “zenith of Newtonian mechanics.”  An attempt by Le Verrier to further extend the dominion of Newton’s gravitational theory to the innermost known planet of the Solar System, Mercury, seemingly came to grief with the discovery of a small unexplained discrepancy in the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, whose value was later calculated as 43”.0 per century.  Le Verrier proposed that it could be explained on the basis of Newtonian theory by assuming the existence of an intra-mercurial planet (“Vulcan”) or ring of debris.  Efforts to confirm this hypothesis, culminating in high drama on the plains of the western United States at the great North American solar eclipse of July 1878, proved futile; by 1908, W. W. Campbell and C.D. Perrine of Lick Observatory, who had carried out exhaustive photographic searches at three eclipses (1901, 1905, and 1908) could declare that Vulcan did not exist.    The theoretical problem it was invoked to explain remained until November 1915, when Albert Einstein used the recently discovered generally covariant gravitational equations to put the problem to rest.  “Perihelion motions explained quantitatively … you will be astonished,” he wrote to his friend Michael Besso.\n",2,

P. Lindner*,R. P. Lindner*,Sessioned,Univ. of Michigan,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Mr. Tompkins, the hero of George Gamow's most famous book, was born in the first decade of the twentieth century and lived until its end.  A bank clerk by day, Mr. Tompkins had wide-ranging interests, and his curiosity led him to popular scientific presentations, and these in turn brought him a long and happy marriage to Maud, the daughter of a professor of physics.   His lifetime offers an appropriate framework for a meditation on the history of cosmology during the century in which cosmology became a scientific enterprise.  As it happens, Mr. Tompkins' first exposure to cosmology, in which he observed both the expansion and contraction of an oscillating universe in 1939, happened during the long night of relativity, the generation in which relativity specialists became few and, like the galaxies, far between.  This talk will consider the heyday of early relativistic cosmology from 1917 to 1935, the causes and consequences of the ""long night"" from 1935 until 1963, and the renaissance of cosmology, which, occurring as it did upon the retirement of Mr. Tompkins, afforded him great pleasure in his later years.\n",3,

L. Trimble*,V. L. Trimble*,Sessioned,"UC, Irvine","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Einstein’s (and Hilbert’s) equations saw light of day in the darkness of Berlin 1915, as is well known. Moving from this highlight to less conspicuous topics, we find Karl Schwarzschild’s solution of those equations (1916) followed shortly by his death. On the observational and American front, Slipher’s assemblage of galaxy radial velocities, begun in 1912 with M31, continued apace. Shapley was busily moving us out of the galactic center. Also at Mt. Wilson, Charles St. John looked for gravitational redshift in the solar spectrum in 1917 without firmly detecting it. Adams demonstrated the very low luminosities of Sirius B and 40 Eri B in 1914 (but his attempt at a redshift for the former came only in 1923). Perhaps least well known is that a handful of additional critical theoretical papers date from the war years and describe the Lense-Thirring effect, the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, and a charged solution with a cosmological constant (due to the even more obscure Friedrich Kottler). Some of these came out of neutral Holland, but Kottler served both at Ypres and on the Galician front. Interesting mixes of military service and relativistic contributions are also associated with the names of Friedmann, Le Lemaître, Weyl (of the tensor), Minkowski, Hubble, Flamm, Droste, and Kretschmann. Astronomers in neutral Denmark, Holland and (until 1917) the USA facilitated transmittal of astronomical observations and other news across the battle lines so that Schwarzschild received an obituary in <u>Nature</u> and Moseley one in <u>Naturwissenschaften</u>.\n",4,

General realtivity is the essential foundation of modern cosmology and underlies our detailed description of the black holes and neutron stars that are ultimately responsible for the most powerful and dramatic cosmic sources. The interface with physics on both the largest and the smallest scales continues to be very fertile.

Stern*,Sessioned,SwRI,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Pluto system was recently explored by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, making closest approach on 14 July 2015. Pluto’s surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto’s atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto’s diverse surface geology and long term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years (Gyr) after formation. Pluto’s large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its North Pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected. In this talk I will summarize the objectives of the New Horizons mission, its scientific payload, and survey key results obtained to date about Pluto and its system of moons.\n",1,

Trump*,Sessioned,Penn State,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): I will present the first robust measurement of black hole occupation over a wide range of host galaxy mass (8<log(M*/Msun)<12) at 0<z<2.5.  A complete AGN census is made possible by using HST spatially resolved spectroscopy, which reliably distinguishes a nuclear AGN from extended star formation and largely avoids the star-formation dilution bias plaguing traditional low-mass AGN selection.  The observations suggest bimodal seed formation: while many low-mass galaxies host massive black holes, their black hole occupation is ~10% that of massive galaxies.  The measured black hole occupation qualitatively agrees with theoretical models of black hole formation, with massive direct-collapse seeds forming only in massive halos and black hole formation confined to lower-mass Pop III remnants in small halos.\n",1,

Compared with previous studies of unobscured AGN at these high redshifts, our sources have lower AGN luminosities, corresponding to significantly higher number densities, of order ∼10<sup>-6</sup>-10<sup>−5</sup> Mpc<sup>−3</sup>. The new K-band data covers the spectral region surrounding the broad Hbeta or Halpha emission lines, and enables the estimation of black hole masses (M<sub>BH</sub>) and accretion rates (in terms of L/L<sub>Edd</sub>). The lower AGN luminosities also allow for robust determinations of the host galaxies stellar masses, therefore enabling us to trace the evolution of the BH-to-stellar mass ratio (M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>*</sub>) to z~3.5. Compared with the rarer, higher-luminosity quasars targeted in previous studies, we find that the 12 AGN in our sample have lower M<sub>BH</sub> (~5x10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>), but similar accretion rates (L/L<sub>Edd</sub>~0.1-0.5). The BH-to-stellar mass ratio, M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>*</sub>, has a large scatter, with several sources reaching extremely high ratios of M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>* </sub>~ 10% - higher by at least an order of magnitude than what is observed in the local Universe. The typical mass ratio for our sample is consistent with a trend of M<sub>BH</sub>/M<sub>* </sub>~ (1+z)<sup>2</sup>.

Veilleux,Sessioned,University of Florida; University of Bath; Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics; Space Telescope Science Institute; University of Maryland,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present preliminary results from an HST imaging study of FeLoBAL quasars, which have extremely low-ionization Broad Absorption Line (BAL) outflows and might be a young quasar population based on their red colors, large far-IR luminosities (suggesting high star formation rates), and powerful outflows. Some models of quasar - host galaxy evolution propose a triggering event, such as a merger, to fuel both a burst of star formation and the quasar/AGN activity. These models suggest young quasars are initially obscured inside the dusty starburst until a ""blowout"" phase, driven by the starburst or quasar outflows like FeLoBALs, ends the star formation and reveals the visibly luminous quasar. Despite the popularity of this evolution scheme, there is little observational evidence to support the role of mergers in triggering AGN or the youth of dust-reddened quasars (such as FeLoBALs) compared to normal blue quasars.<br /><br />Our Cycle 22 HST program is designed to test the youth of FeLoBAL quasars and the connection of FeLoBALs to mergers. We obtain WFC3/IR F160W images of 10 FeLoBAL quasars at redshift z~0.9 (covering ~8500A in the quasar rest frame). We will compare the host galaxy morphologies and merger signatures of FeLoBALs with normal blue quasars (which are older according to the evolution model) and non-AGN galaxies matched in redshift and stellar mass. If FeLoBAL quasars are indeed in a young evolutionary state, close in time to the initial merging event, they should have stronger merger features compared to blue quasars and non-AGN galaxies. Preliminary results suggest that this is not the case - FeLoBAL quasars appear to reside in faint, compact hosts with weak or absent merger signatures. We discuss the implications of these results for galaxy evolution models and other studies of dust-reddened quasar populations.<br />\n",3,

McNulty,Sessioned,George Mason University; Naval Research Laboratory; University of Victoria; Large Binocular Telescope Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Since the vast majority of galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxy interactions trigger nuclear gas accretion, a direct consequence of the hierarchical model of galaxy formation would be the existence of binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The existence, frequency, and characteristics of such binary AGNs have important astrophysical implications on the SMBH mass function, the interplay between SMBHs and the host galaxy, and the M-sigma relation. Despite decades of searching, and strong theoretical reasons that they should exist, observationally confirmed cases of binary AGNs are extremely rare, and most have been discovered serendipitously. Using the all-sky WISE survey, we identified a population of over one hundred strongly interacting galaxies that display extreme red mid-infrared colors thus far exclusively associated in extragalactic sources with powerful AGNs.  In this talk, I will summarize follow-up X-ray and near-IR spectroscopic observations of this population that reveal a population of optically quiescent dual AGNs at kpc scales. These observations demonstrate that mid_IR surveys are an ideal pre-selection strategy in finding dual AGNs in the most advanced mergers.\n",4,

We obtained simultaneous spectroscopic data from the Lick Observatory 3-m telescope using the Kast Double Spectrograph and photometry data from five ground-based telescopes, and used reverberation mapping (RM) techniques to measure the emission-line light curves’ lags relative to continuum variations. We obtained lags for H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, and He II, and obtained the first black hole mass measurement for this object. Our results will serve as a reference point for future studies on relations between black hole mass and continuum variability characteristics using Kepler AGN light curves.<br /><br />The second project, in collaboration with the AGN STORM team, aims to understand the structure and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in NGC 5548 in both UV and optical wavelengths. To supplement 6 months of HST UV observations, we obtained simultaneous optical spectroscopic data from six ground-based observatories. We obtained emission-line lags for the optical H-beta and He II lines as well as velocity-resolved lag measurements for H-beta. We also compared the velocity-resolved lags for H-beta to the UV emission lines C IV and Ly-alpha and found similar lag profiles for all three lines.<br /><br />Finally, I will discuss my contributions to two other collaborations in AGN RM. A key component in RM is monitoring continuum variability, which is often done through ground-based photometry. I will present a pipeline that performs aperture photometry on any number of images of an AGN with WCS coordinates and immediately produces relative light curves. This pipeline enables quick looks of AGN variability in real time and has been used in the LAMP 2011 and the LCOGT Key Project collaborations. It is also applicable to large archival datasets in preparation for survey campaigns in the near future.\n",5,

Kinematic substructure is known to contaminate and bias σ<sub>*</sub> determinations from long-slit spectroscopy, ultimately limiting the utility of the M<sub>BH</sub> - σ<sub>*</sub> relation. We present the first results from the BRAVE program, the goal of which is to use integral-field spectroscopy to more accurately determine σ<sub>*</sub> for the calibrating sample of ∼30 reverberation-mapped AGN. We have used the new HexPak IFU at WIYN to observe eight nearby, low-inclination AGN in this sample. We present first results from these observations and discuss how the line of sight velocity distribution may be used to identify and correct for contamination by kinematic substructure, in order to more accurately determine σ<sub>*</sub> for calibration of the M<sub>BH</sub> - σ<sub>*</sub> relation for AGN.\n",7,

NGC 6814 is only the third galaxy for which the comparison of these two techniques has been accomplished in the same galaxy. Though stellar dynamical modeling is currently thought to be the most direct way of measuring a SMBH mass, it is quite limited because it can only be performed on nearby galaxies that have a spatially resolvable (or nearly so) black hole gravitational sphere of influence. In contrast, reverberation mapping, which relies on time resolution and not spatial resolution, can be used to constrain black hole masses in even the most distant quasars. Reverberation masses, however, carry with them an uncertainty based on the unknown geometry of the photoionized broad line region. This uncertainty affects our ability to accurately measure masses of AGN not just for reverberation masses, but also for the thousands of masses that rely on the reverberation sample for their calibration. This comparison of the mass of the central supermassive black hole in NGC 6814 using both stellar dynamical and reverberation mapping techniques is part of a larger effort to directly compare these techniques in several galaxies. The more galaxies for which this comparison can be performed, the better we will be able to understand the scatter and potential biases in black hole masses and therefore supermassive black hole evolution across cosmic time.\n",8,

The results suggest that the galaxies have accreted metal-poor gas in the starburst regions. Tadpole galaxies, which have a main star-forming head and a tail, are common at high redshift but rare locally. Local tadpoles tend to be XMPs. We present multiband HST WFC3 observations of Kiso 5639, one of the tadpole XMPs in our GTC sample.

Formation of galaxies within dark matter halos is sensitive to the physical phenomena occurring within and around the halo. This is especially true for dwarf galaxies, which have the smallest potential wells and are more susceptible to the effects of gas ionization and removal than larger galaxies. At dwarf galaxies scales comparisons of dark matter-only simulations with observations has unveiled various differences including the core-cusp, the missing satellites, and the too-big-to-fail problems. We have run a new suite of hydrodynamical simulations using the ART code to examine the evolution of dwarf galaxies in massive host environments. These are cosmological zoom-in simulations including deterministic star formation and stellar feedback in the form of supernovae feedback, stellar winds, radiation pressure, and photoionization pressure. We simulates galaxies with final halo masses on the order of 10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> with high resolution, allowing us to examine the satellite dwarf galaxies and local isolated dwarf galaxies around each primary galaxy. We analyzed the abundance and structure of these dwarfs specifically the velocity function, their star formation rates, core creation and the circumgalactic medium. By reproducing observations of dwarf galaxies in simulations we show how including baryons in simulations relieves tensions seen in comparing dark matter only simulations with observations.\n",3,

Haynes,Sessioned,Cornell University; ASTRON; Macalester College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): A long standing problem in cosmology is the mismatch between the number of low mass dark matter halos predicted by simulations and the number of low mass galaxies observed in the Local Group. We recently presented a set of isolated ultra-compact high velocity clouds (UCHVCs) identified within the dataset of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) HI line survey that are consistent with representing low mass gas-bearing dark matter halos within the Local Group (Adams+ 2013). At distances of ~1 Mpc, the UCHVCs have HI masses of ~10^5 Msun and indicative dynamical masses of ~10^7 Msun. The HI diameters of the UCHVCs range from 4' to 20', or 1 to 6 kpc at a distance of 1 Mpc. We have selected the most compact and isolated UCHVCs with the highest average column densities as representing the best galaxy candidates. These systems have been observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to enable higher spatial resolution studies of the HI distribution. From these data, the sources break into two clear categories. Two of the sources maintain a smooth HI morphology at higher resolution, show a velocity gradient and have the highest peak column densities of the sample, indicating they are good candidates to represent gas in dark matter halos. In fact, one of  these sources, AGC 198606, has a tentative stellar counterpart detection (Janesh+ 2015). Nine of the sources break into clumps at higher angular resolution, show no ordered velocity motion, and have significantly lower peak column densities, indicating they are likely Galactic halo HI clouds. One source straddles the two categories with a relatively smooth HI morphology and some evidence for ordered velocity motion while having a lower peak column density. These observations show that higher resolution HI data is a good way to address the galaxy hypothesis for isolated HI clouds, and future HI surveys with phased-array feeds on interferometers, such as Apertif, will be able to directly detect and discriminate among these sources.\n",4,

LITTLE THINGS uses high angular resolution (~6<b><sup>’’</sup></b>), high spectral resolution (≤ 2.6 km s<sup>–1</sup>), and high sensitivity (≤ 1.1 mJy beam<sup>–1</sup> channel<sup>–1</sup>) H I observations of 41 nearby (≤ 10.3 Mpc) gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We are interested in dwarf galaxies because they are the most common types of galaxies in the local universe and they are believed to be the first galaxies to form in the universe. Here we study the interaction between star formation evolution and the interstellar medium from which stars form. In the sample, we detected 306 holes with sizes ranging from about 38 pc to 2.3 kpc, the expansion rates varying from 5 to 30 km s<sup>–1</sup>, and the estimated kinetic age varying from 1 Myr to 127 Myr. The distribution of the holes per unit area is found nearly constant both inside (51%) and outside (49%) of the V-band break radius, where the radial luminosity function changes slope. We derived surface and volume porosity and found that porosity doesn’t correlate with star formation rate (SFR) for the LITTLE THINGS sample. Assuming that the holes are formed from the stellar feedback, we calculated the supernova rate (SNR) and the SFR. We did find a correlation between the SFR calculated from Hα (a star formation tracer) and the SFR estimated from the SNR, consistent with hole formation from stellar feedback. The relation between the estimated kinetic ages of the holes with the SNR gives the indication of the star formation history.\n",5,

Cigan,Sessioned,IBM Research Div.; Lowell Observatory; University of Chile; University of Hertfordshire; Joint ALMA Observatory; Cardiff University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The radial profiles of star formation rates and surface mass densities for gas and stars have been compiled for 20 local dwarf irregular galaxies and converted into disk scale heights and Toomre Q values. The scale heights are relatively large compared to the galaxy sizes (~0.6 times the local radii) and generally increase with radius in a flare. The gaseous Q values are high, ~4, at most radii and even higher for the stars. Star formation proceeds even with these high Q values in a normal exponential disk as viewed in the far ultraviolet. Such normal star formation suggests that Q is not relevant to star formation in dIrrs. The star formation rate per unit area always equals approximately the gas surface density divided by the midplane free fall time with an efficiency factor of about 1% that decreases systematically with radius in approximate proportion to the gas surface density. We view this efficiency variation as a result of a changing molecular fraction in a disk where atomic gas dominates both stars and molecules. In a related study, CO observations with ALMA of star-forming regions at the low metallicities of these dwarfs, which averages 13% solar, shows, in the case of the WLM galaxy, tiny CO clouds inside much larger molecular and atomic hydrogen envelopes. The CO cloud mass fraction within the molecular region is only one percent or so. Nevertheless, the CO clouds have properties that are similar to solar neighborhood clouds: they satisfy the size-linewidth relation observed in the LMC, SMC, and other local dwarfs where CO has been observed, and the same virial mass versus luminosity relation. This uniforming of CO cloud properties seems to be the result of a confining pressure from the weight of the overlying molecular and atomic shielding layers. Star formation at low metallicity therefore appears to be a three dimensional process independent of 2D instabilities involving Q, in highly atomic gas with relatively small CO cores, activated at a rate given by the local average midplane density.\n",6,

We derive a new, non-grey analytical model for the thermal structure of irradiated exoplanets. Using two different opacity bands in the thermal frequency range, we highlight the dual role of thermal non-grey opacities in shaping the temperature profile of the atmosphere. Opacities dominated by lines enable the upper atmosphere to cool down significantly compared to a grey atmosphere whereas opacities dominated by bands lead both to a significant cooling of the upper atmosphere and a significant heating of the deep atmosphere.<br /><br />We compare our analytical model to a grid of temperature-pressure profiles for solar composition atmospheres obtained with a state-of-the-art numerical model taking into account the full wavelength, temperature and pressure dependence of the opacities. We demonstrate the importance of thermal non-grey opacities in setting the deep temperature of irradiated giant planets atmospheres. In the particular case of highly irradiated planets we show that the presence of TiO in their atmospheres alters both the optical and the thermal opacities. The greenhouse effect – a semi-grey effect – and the “blanketing effect” - an intrisically non-grey effect – contribute equally to set the deep temperature profile of the planet atmosphere. We conclude that non-grey thermal effects are fundamental to understand the deep temperature profile of hot Jupiters.<br /><br />Our calibrated analytical model matches the numerical model within 10% over a wide range of effective temperature, internal temperature and gravities and properly predict the depth of the radiative/convective boundary, an important quantity to understand the cooling history of a giant planet.

First, published data from previous observations of the secondary eclipse (and transit for HD 189733b) are compared to models created with the Versatile Software for the Transfer of Atmospheric Radiation (VSTAR). Second, new polarimetric observations from the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument are compared to Lambert-Rayleigh polarised light phase curves. For the non-transiting planets, only the polarimetric measurements are compared to models, but toy radiative transfer models are produced for concept. As an introduction to radiative transfer models, VSTAR is applied to the planet Uranus to measure its D/H isotope ratio. A preliminary value is derived for D/H in one part of the atmosphere.<br /><br />Fitting a single atmospheric model to the transmitted, reflected, and emitted light, I confirm the presence of water on HD 189733b, and present a new temperature profile and cloud profile for the planet.

I detect a possible variation with phase for transiting planet WASP-18b but cannot confirm it at this time. Alternative sources to the planet are discussed.

During my thesis, I have studied the impact of clouds and hazes in a variety of substellar objects. First, I present results for cool brown dwarfs including clouds previously neglected in model atmospheres. Model spectra that include sulfide and salt clouds can match the spectra of T dwarf atmospheres; water ice clouds will alter the spectra of the newest and coldest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs. These sulfide/salt and ice clouds potentially drive spectroscopic variability in these cool objects, and this variability should be distinguishable from variability caused by hot spots.<br /><br />Next, I present results for small, cool exoplanets between the size of Earth and Neptune, so-called super Earths. They likely have sulfide and salt clouds and also have photochemical hazes caused by stellar irradiation. Vast resources have been dedicated to characterizing the handful of super Earths accessible to current telescopes, yet of the planets smaller than Neptune studied to date, all have radii in the near-infrared consistent with being constant in wavelength, likely showing that these small planets are consistently enshrouded in thick hazes and clouds. Very thick, lofted clouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity (1000× solar) atmospheres create featureless transmission spectra in the near-infrared. Photochemical hazes with a range of particle sizes also create featureless transmission spectra at lower metallicities. I show that despite these challenges, there are promising avenues for understanding this class of small planets: by observing the thermal emission and reflectivity of small planets, we can break the degeneracies and better constrain the atmospheric compositions.

Direct evidence for AGN affecting the molecular ISM has so far been limited to detections of molecular outflows in low-redshift systems and extreme excitation regions which represent a tiny fraction of the total gas. Indirect evidence for AGN's impact on their host galaxies' cold gas phase may be provided by measurements of the gas excitation and dynamics. At z~2-3, the peak epoch of star formation and AGN activity, previous observations of the CO(1-0) line revealed that submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) have multi-phase molecular gas, including substantial reservoirs of cold-phase gas.

Shipley*,Sessioned,Texas A&M University; Tufts University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): For decades, significant work has been applied to calibrating emission from the ultra-violet, nebular emission lines, far-infrared, X-ray and radio as tracers of the star-formation rate (SFR) in distant galaxies.  Understanding the exact rate of star-formation and how it evolves with time and galaxy mass has deep implications for how galaxies form.  The co-evolution of star-formation and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion is one of the key problems in galaxy formation theory.  But, many of these SFR indicators are influenced by SMBH accretion in galaxies and result in unreliable SFRs.  Utilizing the luminous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, I provide a new robust SFR calibration using the luminosity emitted from the PAHs at 6.2μm, 7.7μm and 11.3μm to solve this.  The PAH features emit strongly in the mid-infrared (mid-IR; 5-25μm) mitigating dust extinction, containing on average 5-10% of the total IR luminosity in galaxies.  I use a sample of 105 star-forming galaxies covering a range of total IR luminosity, L<sub>IR</sub> = L(8-1000μm) = 10<sup>9</sup> - 10<sup>12 </sup>L<sub>⊙</sub> and redshift 0 < <i>z</i> < 0.4, with mid-IR spectroscopy from the <i>Spitzer</i> Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), and data covering other SFR indicators (Hα emission and rest-frame 24μm continuum emission).  The PAH luminosity correlates linearly with the SFR as measured by the Hα luminosity (corrected for attenuation using the mono-chromatic rest-frame 24μm emission), with a tight scatter of <0.15 dex.  The scatter is comparable to that between SFRs derived from the Paα and dust-corrected Hα emission lines.  We present a case study in advance of <i>JWST</i>, which will be capable of measuring SFRs (from 8μm rest-frame photometry, i.e. PAHs) in distant galaxies (<i>z</i> ≤ 2) with <i>JWST</i>/MIRI to SFRs as low as ~10 M<sub>⊙</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup>, because the PAH features are so bright.  We use <i>Spitzer</i>/IRS observations of PAH features in lensed star-forming galaxies at 1 < <i>z</i> < 3 to demonstrate the utility of the PAHs to derive SFRs that agree with those available from Paα.

We present a new 1.1 mm survey of two of the <i>HST</i> Frontier Fields clusters taken with AzTEC on the Large Millimeter Telescope. The clusters act as cosmic telescopes to amplify lower-luminosity galaxies, probing further down the millimeter luminosity function than possible with blank-field observations, and detecting dust in galaxies with star formation rates as low as <10 solar masses per year. We present our deep number counts, including detailed simulations to account for the magnifications, and the multi-wavelength properties of our millimeter detections. We discuss the nature of these sources relative to previous (sub)millimeter surveys.

Wiklind*,T. Wiklind*,Sessioned,Catholic University of America,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The average morphology of the most massive galaxies change dramatically with cosmic time. At z>1.5, the most massive galaxies are characterized by an exponential light distribution, while galaxies at lower redshift are spheroidal with a de Vaucoleur light profile. This morphological transformation is accompanied by a drastic change in star formation activity. The mechanism(s) responsible for these two transformations are unknown. This work combines ALMA observations of the gas and dust content with CANDELS optical/NIR data of five carefully selected samples of galaxies. Using a mean abundance matching technique, each of the five samples contain galaxies that are likely to be the progenitors of a galaxy of a given stellar mass at z=0. Preliminary results suggests that for a given mass sample, the median star formation activity decreases at an earlier epoch than the change of median morphology (as measured by the Sersic index). This is more pronounced for progenitors of the most massive descendants. The implication is that at redshifts z~1-2 there should be a large population of quiescent disk galaxies. An alternative is that these disk galaxies enter a phase of dust-obscured star formation. This possibility will be tested with the ALMA submm observations.\n",6,

Connors*,M. Connors*; H. Mandel; M. Demleitner,Sessioned,Athabasca University; Landesternwarte Heidelberg; University of Heidelberg,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Max Wolf, director of the Heidelberg Observatory (Landessternwarte Königsstuhl), was the most prodigious discoverer of asteroids in the early twentieth century. He is now best known for the discovery of the Trojan asteroids associated with Jupiter in 1906, but was a pioneer in the application of photographic techniques to astronomy, particularly for conducting asteroid surveys. His attention to detail and perseverance also led to the discovery of the near-Earth asteroid 887 Alinda, which is the eponym of an orbital class in 3:1 resonance with Jupiter. Alinda class contains several potentially hazardous asteroids, and has been particularly instructive in development of theories of eccentricity increase for resonant asteroids. Alinda was discovered on January 3, 1918, on the very edge of one of two plates taken with the 40 cm aperture Bruce double astrograph. The inability to reduce a long trail going off the plate meant that only one month later could the object again be found with the Bruce telescope, and later observed with the follow-up instrument, the 72 cm aperture Waltz reflector. In what Wolf referred to as “the greatest embarrassment of my life”, reflector observations had him conclude that Alinda had a satellite. At a time when plates had to be exposed for several hours, laboriously developed and analyzed, and in the case of high eccentricity objects like Alinda, predicted with inadequate theories, Wolf’s persistence allowed it never to be lost. Despite this, its essential resonant nature was not determined until 1969, despite the pioneering work by Brown (1911) on resonance in the asteroid belt and the knowledge dating to the late nineteenth century work of Kirkwood that commensurabilities were important in its structure. The majority of Wolf’s plates are available as online scans through the Heidelberg Digitized Astronomical Plates project of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory, but the Alinda discovery plate, which was broken, was scanned specially.\n",3,

Clark to build a 24-inch refractor. Lowell intended the telescope intitally for observing Mars in support of his controversial theories about life on that planet. Clark finished the telescope within a year and at a cost of $20,000. Lowell and his staff of assistants and astronomers began observing through it on July 23, 1896, setting off a long and productive career for the telescope.<br /><br />While Lowell’s Mars studies dominated early work with the Clark, V.M. Slipher by the 1910s was using it to observe planetary rotations and atmospheric compositions. He soon revolutionized spectroscopic studies, gathering excruciatingly long spectra – some in excess of 40 hours – of the so-called white nebula and determining startling radial velocities, evidence of an expanding universe. In the 1960s, scientists and artists teamed up on the Clark and created detailed lunar maps in support of the Apollo program.<br /><br />In recent decades, the Clark has played a central role in the education programs at Lowell, with general public audiences, students, and private groups all taking advantage of this unique resource.<br /><br />With this nearly 120 years of contant use, the Clark had been wearing down in recent years. The telescope was becoming more difficult to move, old electrical wiring in the dome was a fire hazard, and many of the telescope's parts needed to be repaired or replaced.<br /><br />In 2013, Lowell Observatory began a fundraising campaign, collecting $291,000 to cover the cost of dome and telescope renovation. Workers removed the entire telescope mount and tube assembly from the dome, examining every part from tube sections to individuals screws. They also stabilized the dome, adding a water vapor barrier and new outer wall while reinforcing the upper dome. The project lasted from January, 2014 through August, 2015.

L. Trimble*,V. L.

Thus the first dark matter candidate was the counter-earth of Philolaus (c. 460 BCE), with its illuminated face forever turned away from us.  The eclipsing binary interpretation of Algol brought forward the idea (Pigott & Goodricke 1780s) of stars not yet lit up, while the incorporation of thermodynamics into the astronomical tool kit suggested dark, dead stars.  Jeans reported a number for these about three times the number of illuminated stars in 1922, the same year that Kapteyn set a comparable limit to what he called dark matter.  The phrase appears as an index item in Russell et al.’s 1927 <u>Astronomy</u> and cannot, therefore, have been invented any later.  The first extragalactic investigation seems to have been that by Knut Lundmark, writing in German in the Meddelande of the Lund Observatory in 1930.  One of the columns of his Tabelle 4 is headed: (Leuchtende + dunkle Materia)/(Leuchtende Materie) and lists values from six up to 100 for six galaxies, e.g. Messier 51 (10), Andromedanebel (20), and NGC 4594 (30).  Binary galaxies came from Holmberg (1937), Virgo from Sinclair Smith (1936), and flat rotation curves from Babcock (1939, Andromeda) and Oort (1940, NGC 3115), the latter writing cautiously that the distribution of mass seemed to be very different from that of the light.  Then there was a war, but by the time of a 1961 symposium in Santa Barbara focused on the large velocity dispersions in clusters of galaxies, the votes for dark matter slightly outnumbered those for unbound clusters and other alternatives.  The idea of a constant of gravity increasing with distance came a smidge later from Arigo Finzi in 1963.  The tipping point was arguably 1974 with a pair of short papers summarizing M/L ratios vs. distance scale (which could, of course, have been plotted before WWII).  I mention only the slightly earlier and much less often cited one by Einasto, Kaasik, and Saar (published in <u>Nature</u>, in case you are thinking of more Meddelande).  I feel enormous respect and affection for Vera Rubin and Fritz Zwicky, but the published papers as are they are.\n",6,

Once luminosity effects<br />are considered, the basic X-ray continuum properties of most high-redshift AGNs appear remarkably similar to those of local AGNs, although there are some notable apparent exceptions (e.g., highly radio-loud quasars). Furthermore, the X-ray absorption found in some objects has been used as a diagnostic of outflowing winds and circumnuclear material. Demographically, the X-ray data now support an exponential decline in the number density of luminous AGNs above z ~ 3, and quantitative space-density comparisons for optically selected and X-ray selected quasars indicate basic statistical agreement.<br /><br />The current X-ray discoveries point the way toward the future breakthroughs that will be possible with, e.g., Athena and the X-ray<br />Surveyor.

This may be done using a Gamma Ray or an X-ray Laser. At first glance it has the look and feel of yet another Noble Gas Laser. The difference is that it uses Neutron states within the Nucleus. The Neutrons would be emitted with a modulated Gamma or X-ray photon. In essence it may be possible to have a totally new type of Laser---This author calls them ""Matter Lasers"", where a lower energy photon with fewer Quantum Numbers would be used with a Noble Gas to produce a particle beam with higher energy and more Quantum Numbers. It may be possible to replace cumbersome particle accelerators with this type of Laser, to make mass from energy, via a Neutron Gas. This would be a great technological advance in Rocket Propulsion as well; low mass photon to high mass particle, such as a Higgs particle or a Top Quark. The Xenon 135, could come from a Fission Reactor within the Space Craft, as it is a reactor poison. The workings of an X-ray laser is already known and table top versions of it have been developed. Gamma Ray lasers are already in use and have been tested. A Laser would have a columnated beam with a very precise direction, unlike just a Neutron source which would go in all directions. Of course this beam could be used as a spectroscopic tool as well, in order to determine the composition of the matter that the spacecraft encounters. The spectroscopic tool could look for ""Dark Matter"" and other exotic types of matter that may occur in outerspace. The spacecraft could potentially reach ""near speed of light velocities"" in a fairly short time, since the Laser would be firing off massive particles, with great momentum. Lastly the precise Neutron beam could be used as a very powerful weapon or as a way of clearing space debri, since it could ""force Nuclear Reactions"" onto the object being fired upon, making it the ultimate space weapon, and Propulsion device in one package, using existing technologies, devices and theories. With this theory, it is now just an Engineering Problem, to make it work, and a great deal of funding. The benifits would be so enormous that this should be given priority.\n",3,

BETTII will provide 0.5 to 1 arcsecond spatial resolution and spectral resolving power of 10 to 100 between 30 and 90 microns, where most of the dust continuum emission peaks in local star forming regions. It will achieve spatially-resolved spectroscopy of bright, dense cores with unprecedented high definition. This talk focuses on the main challenges and solutions associated with building BETTII: thermal stability, attitude/pointing control, and path length stabilization. In each of these areas we look at the trade-off between design, control, and knowledge in order to achieve the best-possible instrumental capability and sensitivity.<br /><br />As a first step towards resolving cluster cores, we surveyed 10 nearby star-forming clusters with SOFIA FORCAST at 11, 19, 31 and 37 microns. The FORCAST instrument has the highest angular resolution currently available in the far-IR. We use it to gain new insights in these important regions of stellar birth by now unambiguously matching the far-IR fluxes to their shorter wavelengths counterparts, and improve our understanding of clustered sources using SED modeling.\n",4,

Early works from the 1960s and 1970s differ typically by 5 to 10% or more.  The flux density scale proposed by Scaife and Heald (2012) is a reconciliation of these existing scales, applicable to six compact northern sources, but does not include new data, nor does it extend to any southern sources.  The situation for southern sources is considerably poorer, as most of the early work was limited to northern sources. <br /><br />The major causes of the discrepancies between proposed scales is in the limited resolution and imaging fidelity of the telescopes utilized.   The Jansky Very Large Array has been designed for high linearity, resolution, and imaging fidelity, and is thus ideally suited for making accurate measurements of the flux density ratios between proposed calibrator sources.  These ratios can then be placed on an absolute scale through knowedge of the spectrum of one of more of the sources. <br /><br />We report here on the results of two recent programs using the Jansky Very Large Array:<br />1) Establishment of the absolute flux densities of eighteen sources (including seven southern sources) from 75 MHz to 48 GHz (limits vary for each source) using the absolutely-calibrated spectrum of Cygnus A (Baars et al., 1977) for frequencies lower than 1 GHz, and the proposed, absolutely-calibrated scale of Perley and Butler (2013) for frequencies above 1 GHz. <br />2) Extension of this scale to 30 compact southern sources proposed as calibrators, utilizing 3C48 (whose absolute spectrum is calibrated above) as the standard. <br /><br /><br />Polynomial expressions for the spectra, and images for all objects have been generated and will be available. <br />\n",5,

Slosar,Sessioned,Brookhaven National Laboratory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): With the advancement of Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements to larger scales and to greater precision, it is crucial that we also improve our understanding of the bias between the measured flux and the underlying matter power spectrum, especially for future percent level cosmology constraints. In order to develop an intuition for the physics driving the values of the density and velocity bias parameters of the Lyman-alpha forest, we have run a series of hydrodynamic SPH simulations to test existing approximations found in the literature. Through a series of progressively more realistic scenarios, we first introduce flux based on the Fluctuating Gunn Peterson Approximation, just using the density fields, then introduce redshift space distortions, as well as thermal broadening, and finally, analyzing the full hydrodynamic part of the simulations. We find surprising agreement between the analytical approximations developed by Seljak (2012) and the numerical methods in the limit of linear redshift space-distortions and no thermal broadening. Specifically, we find that the prediction of the analytical velocity bias expression is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening, and speculate that the measurement of this bias along with a small-scale measurement of the flux PDF, could yield a possible probe of the thermal state of the IGM. A deeper understanding of the large-scale Lyman-alpha biasing will also help us in using the large-scale clustering of the forest as a cosmological probe beyond baryon acoustic oscillations.\n",1,

We have developed a structure finding algorithm which uses the rate of change of the density gradient to self-consistently parse and follow the evolution of groups/clusters, filaments and voids in large scale simulations. We use this to map the evolution of the baryon gas phase distribution and the star formation history within the different structures. This examination yields new insights into the location of star forming regions and the gas phase distribution within the filamentary environment. Although the majority of the WHIM is associated with filaments, their multiphase nature and the fact that star formation occurs in condensed gas regions both advise against conflating the filamentary environment with the WHIM. We track the path of star forming halos through the Cosmic Web to expose their environmental history, revealing the multiphase nature and time-dependence of the physical environment of galaxies and their associated circumgalactic medium.\n",2,

To constrain the relationship between these gas reservoirs and galaxy properties, I have carried out deep and highly complete surveys of several thousand galaxies in fields with high quality absorption spectra of background quasars from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. The survey results imply that (1) highly ionized, heavy-element enriched gas traced by OVI absorption primarily arise in low-mass, gas-rich galaxy groups rather than the warm-hot phase of the intergalactic medium and that (2) galaxies with nearby neighbors exhibit more extened OVI absorbing gas than isolated galaxies. Together, these observations suggest that galaxy and group interactions play a role in stripping bound, heavy element enriched halo gas to enrich the intergalactic medium. In addition, I carried out the first large survey of circumgalactic gas around active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars. The cool, heavy-element enriched gas content of AGN and quasar host halos is strongly correlated with AGN luminosity, and the gas exhibit extreme kinematics with velocity spread inconsistent with gas bound to the AGN host. These observations provide tantalizing hints at the widespread impact of AGN feedback on the extended gas reservoirs around galaxies.\n",3,

Cooke*,J. Cooke*; J. O'Meara,Sessioned,Swinburne University; Saint Michaels College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The formation and evolution of galaxies requires large reservoirs of cold, neutral gas. The damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs), seen in absorption towards distant quasars and gamma ray bursts, are predicted to be the dominant reservoirs for this gas. Detailed properties of DLAs have been studied extensively for decades with great success. However, their size, fundamental in understanding their nature, has remained elusive, as quasar and gamma ray burst sightlines only probe comparatively tiny areas of the foreground DLAs. Here, we introduce a new approach to measure the full extent of DLAs in the sightlines to extended background sources. We present the discovery of z ~ 2 DLAs with column densities as high as log N(HI) = 21.1 ±0.4 cm<sup>−2</sup> covering 90–100% of the luminous extent of background galaxies. Estimates of the sizes of the background galaxies range from a minimum of a few kpc<sup>2</sup>, to ∼100 kpc<sup>2</sup>, and demonstrate that high-column density neutral gas can span continuous areas 10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>10</sup> times larger than previously explored in quasar or gamma ray burst sightlines. The DLAs are from our pilot survey that searches Lyman break and Lyman continuum galaxies at high redshift. The low luminosities, large sizes, and mass contents (~10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) implied by the early data suggest that DLAs contain the necessary fuel for galaxies, with many systems consistent with relatively massive, low-luminosity primeval galaxies.\n",4,

Khaire*,V. Khaire*; R. Srianand,Sessioned,Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the standard picture, the only sources of cosmic UV background are the quasars and the star forming galaxies. The hydrogen ionizing emissivity from galaxies depends on a parameter known as escape fraction (f<sub>esc</sub>). It is the ratio of the escaping hydrogen ionizing photons from galaxies to the total produced by their stellar population. Using available multi-wavelength and multi-epoch galaxy luminosity function measurements, we update the galaxy emissivity by estimating a self-consistent combination of the star formation rate density and dust attenuation. Using the recent quasar luminosity function measurements, we present an updated hydrogen ionizing emissivity from quasars which shows a factor of ~2 increase as compared to the previous estimates at z<2. We use these in a cosmological radiative transfer code developed by us to generate the UV background and show that the recently inferred high values of hydrogen photoionization rates at low redshifts can be easily obtained with reasonable values of f<sub>esc</sub>. This resolves the problem of 'photon underproduction crisis' and shows that there is no need to invoke non-standard sources of the UV background such as decaying dark matter particles. We will present the implications of this updated quasar and galaxy emissivity on the values of f<sub>esc</sub> at high redshifts and on the cosmic reionization.

Murphy,Sessioned,New Mexico State University; Swinburne University of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present a detailed measurement of the redshift number density of MgII and CIV absorbers as measured in archival VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES spectra. This survey examines 432 VLT/UVES spectra from the UVES SQUAD and 170 Keck/HIRES spectra from the KODIAQ group, allowing for detections of MgII absorbers from 0.08 < z < 2.57 and CIV absorbers from 0.94 < z < 5.45. We employ an accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects absorption lines with equivalent widths W<sub>r</sub> < 0.02 Å in S/N = 40 spectra. We then measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical depth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. This results in a complete sample of strong (W<sub>r</sub> > 0.3 Å) and weak (W<sub>r</sub> < 0.3 Å) MgII/CIV absorbers, allowing for accurate determination of the number density of these absorbers across cosmic time. Preliminary results show power-law behavior for both the MgII and CIV equivalent width distribution functions down to small equivalent widths, implying self-similar absorbing structures. This power law is smooth and shallow at low redshifts (z < 1.5), but has a kink at redshifts between 1.5 < z < 2.5 due to an excess of strong absorbers compared to weak absorbers. At high redshift (z > 2.5), we see fewer strong CIV absorbers, truncating the distribution at the largest equivalent widths. These trends seem to follow our general idea of the history of cosmic metal enrichment, with an evolutionary transition occurring around the time of the global star formation peak of the universe.\n",6,

Some of these include the ionization and excitation of neutral atoms and molecules, the spallation (fragmentation) of heavier nuclei into light element isotopes, and inelastic collisions that produce neutral pions which rapidly decay into pairs of gamma ray photons. Each interaction generates an observable, and each interaction has an energy dependent cross section, such that a suite of observations should be able to constrain the cosmic-ray energy spectrum in a variety of environments outside of our solar system. I am currently using proton spectra inferred in molecular clouds for energies above ~1 GeV from Fermi-LAT observations in concert with abundances of molecular ions sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate that constrain the flux of 1-10 MeV particles for the purpose of investigating how the particle spectrum changes between different locations in our Galaxy, and between diffuse and dense molecular gas. Additionally, somewhere between diffuse and dense gas lies the ""CO-dark"" molecular gas, a regime where hydrogen is in molecular form but CO has yet to reach an appreciable abundance. Estimates of the H<sub>2</sub> mass based solely on CO emission do not account for this material, and it has been estimated that up to 30% of the gas in a molecular cloud is in this phase.

The astrometry is dominated by parallax and proper motion, but with a precision of 0.2 mas per epoch we accurately measure the relative position change caused by the orbital motion of the pair. This allows us to directly measure a mass ratio of q = 0.78 ± 0.10 for this system. We also search for the signature of a planetary-mass companion around either of the A and B component and exclude at 3σ the presence of planets with masses larger than 2 M<sub>J</sub> and orbital periods of 20-300 d. We update the parallax of LUH 16 to 500.51 ± 0.11 mas, i.e. just within 2 pc.

However, our understanding of the evolution from the material in the circumstellar disk to the thousands of planetary systems discovered to date, is limited. One means to better constrain the size, mass, and composition of this planet-forming material is to observe a YSO being eclipsed by its circumstellar disk. Through this dissertation project, we are discovering and characterizing both disk eclipsing systems and exoplanets using the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project. KELT is a photometric survey for transiting planets orbiting bright stars (8 < V < 11); such bright planet host targets are well-suited for atmospheric characterization of the planets. KELT has discovered 15 planets transiting stars brighter than V ~11 to date. I will present some of the recently discovered planets from the survey and discuss their potential to advance our understanding of planetary atmospheres. In addition, KELT provides photometric monitoring of ~3 million stars, presenting the opportunity to perform multi-year studies of stellar variability generally and rare disk occultations specifically. Using time-series photometry from KELT we are conducting the Disk Eclipse Search with KELT (DESK) survey to look for disk eclipsing events, specifically in young stellar associations. To date, the survey has discovered and analyzed four previously unknown large dimming events around the stars RW Aurigae, V409 Tau, AA Tau, and TYC 2505-672-1, the latter now representing the longest-period eclipsing object known (period ~ 69 years).

However, the recent findings of Kepler and radial velocity programs show that planets can and do form in binary systems. Here, we suggest that visual binaries offer unique advantages for direct imaging. We show that Binary Differential Imaging (BDI), whereby two stars are imaged simultaneously at the same wavelength within the isoplanatic patch at high Strehl ratio, offers improved point spread function (PSF) subtraction that can result in increased sensitivity to planets close to each star. We demonstrate this by observing a young visual binary separated by ~ 4 arcseconds with MagAO/Clio-2 at 3.9 μm, where the Strehl ratio is high, the isoplanatic patch is large, and giant planets are bright. Comparing BDI to angular differential imaging (ADI), we find that BDI's 5-sigma contrast is ~ 0.5 mags better than ADI's within ~ 1 arcsecond for the particular binary we observed. Because planets typically reside close to their host stars, BDI is a promising technique for discovering exoplanets in stellar systems that are often ignored. BDI is also 2-4x more efficient than ADI and classical reference PSF subtraction, since planets can be detected around both the target and PSF reference simultaneously. We are currently exploiting this technique in a new MagAO survey for giant planets in 140 young nearby visual binaries. BDI on a space-based telescope would not be limited by isoplanatism effects and would therefore be an even more powerful tool for imaging and discovering planets.<br />\n",7,

The detection of an exomoon would give insight into planetary formation and possibly increase the habitable real estate in a planetary system. Current telescopes are not capable of spatially resolving an exoplanet and its exomoon, or of separating the two blended spectra in a combined light measurement. However, previous work has shown that there is a wavelength dependent photometric centroid shift between a planet and its moon due to the weighted nature of the center of light (Agol et al. 2015). This spectroastrometric shift is highest in bands where the planet is dim and the moon is relatively bright, which can happen if it differs compositionally from its planet.<br /><br />As part of the “Finding the Needles in the Haystacks” project, we generated a realistic spatial / spectral model of an Earth-like exomoon orbiting a warm Jupiter in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, including plausible exozodiacal dust structure. Preliminary results show that the presence of an Earth-like exomoon can produce centroid shifts greater than a milliarcsecond at some wavelengths, enabling the detection of the Earth-like exomoon even in the presence of dust. However, extracting the spectrum of the Earth-like exomoon proved challenging, even when employing a simple telescope simulation devoid of coronagraphic effects, and further work will be needed to determine if it is possible even with 12-meter-class space telescopes.\n",8,

Low-mass fully convective stars do not possess a <u>tachocline</u> and were originally expected to generate only weak small-scale magnetic fields. Observations, however, have painted a different picture of magnetism in rapidly-rotating fully convective stars: (1) <u>Zeeman</u> broadening measurements revealed average surface field of several <u>kiloGauss</u> (<u>kG</u>), which is similar to the typical field strength found in sunspots. (2) <u>Zeeman</u>-Doppler-Imaging (<u>ZDI</u>) technique discovered large-scale magnetic fields with a morphology often similar to the Earth's dipole-dominated field. (3) Comparison of <u>Zeeman</u> broadening and <u>ZDI</u> results showed that more than 80% of the magnetic flux resides at small scales. So far, theoretical and computer simulation efforts have not been able to reproduce these features simultaneously. Here we present a self-consistent global model of magnetic field generation in low-mass fully convective stars. A distributed dynamo working in the model spontaneously produces a dipole-dominated surface magnetic field of the observed strength. The interaction of this field with the turbulent convection in outer layers shreds it, producing small-scale fields that carry most of the magnetic flux. The <u>ZDI</u> technique applied to synthetic <u>spectropolarimetric</u> data based on our model recovers most of the large-scale field. Our model simultaneously reproduces the morphology and magnitude of the large-scale field as well as the magnitude of the small-scale field observed on low-mass fully convective stars.\n",1,

Curtis*,Sessioned,The Pennsylvania State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Ages of stars are difficult to infer because stars change very little during the majority of their lifetimes. However, stars are observed to spin down over time due to magnetic braking, which weakens the magnetic dynamo as well. This spin down has led to a new age dating method called gyrochronology, which has been successfully calibrated for Sun-like stars up to 2.5 Gyr, but is still undetermined at older ages and lower masses. The decay of magnetic activity has also been utilized to empirically calibrate an age relationship at ages less than 600 Myr with nearby young star clusters (e.g. Hyades), and pinned down at 4 Gyr with M67, but the relationship is basically unconstrained at intermediate ages and sub-Solar masses. Advances in observational facilities have brought distant clusters into view, while the discovery of Ruprecht 147 has provided a new benchmark that is the oldest nearby cluster (3 Gyr, 300 pc, Curtis et al. 2013), and which provides a bridge across this historic age gap. I will present new, high quality chromospheric activity data for NGC 752 at 1.5 Gyr and Ruprecht 147 at 3 Gyr.

New gyrochronology models are required in order to explain this behaviour. Fundamental to the continued advancements of our understanding of gyrochronology is the inference of precise and accurate rotation periods for old, inactive and slowly rotating stars in the Kepler, K2 and TESS data sets. We have developed new methods for rotation period inference that are suited to detecting low-amplitude signals in noisy time-series as well as new gyrochronology models which describe the Kepler asteroseismic sample, allowing the age of a star to be inferred from its rotation period and mass proxy alone.\n",4,

R. Newton*,E. R.

Empirical determination of these properties is important for gaining insight into their stellar structure, magnetic field generation, and angular momentum evolution. Knowledge of the stellar parameters is also key to characterizing planetary systems. I used observations to empirically constrain the properties of nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs targeted by the MEarth transiting planet survey. I obtained low-resolution (R=2000) NIR spectra of 450 M dwarfs using SpeX on IRTF. I measured their absolute radial velocities with an accuracy of 4 km/s by exploiting telluric lines to establish an absolute wavelength calibration, and developed techniques to estimate M dwarf metallicities from K-band spectral line equivalent widths (EWs) or 2MASS colors to 0.15 dex. Using stars with interferometric radii, I showed that H-band EWs can be used to infer K and M dwarf temperatures to 69K, and radii to 0.027Rsun. I applied these relations to planet-hosting stars from Kepler, showing that the typical planet is 15% larger than is inferred if adopting other stellar parameters. Using photometry from the MEarth-North Observatory, I measured rotation periods from 0.1 to 150 days for 350 M dwarfs. There is a prevalence of stable spot patterns, and no correlation between period and amplitude for fully-convective stars. Using galactic kinematics as a proxy for age, I demonstrated a smooth age-rotation relation. I found that rapid rotators (P<10 days) are <2 Gyr, and that the slowest are on average 5+-3 Gyr old.

Variability across a wide range of timescales (from hours to decades) is observed in this class of objects, including stellar pulsations, outbursts, oscillations in the circumstellar disk, and the total disappearance (or reappearance) of the disk. Using data from the KELT survey (Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope; a wide-field photometric survey designed to find transiting exoplanets with high precision of ~1% and baselines up to 10 years for ~3 million objects), we investigate the light curves of ~300 known Be stars and find many systems exhibiting the aforementioned types of variability. Many of these Be stars also have existing spectra simultaneous with the KELT photometry, providing a unique look into the correlation between spectroscopic features and photometric variability, and allowing us to study how these observables relate to the underlying physical processes present in Be stars.\n",1,

One particular ELM WD (SDSS J111215.82+111745.0) has been observed to pulsate at periods so short that the pulsations may be p-modes, making this star unique among all WD pulsators. Since the ELM WDs are thought to be formed only through binary, and not single star evolution, the observed periods give the opportunity to constrain the interiors of these post-common-envelope or post-Roche-lobe-overflow WD through asteroseismology. I will discuss our recent efforts to construct models of these these ELM WD pulsators using the MESA stellar evolution code to carry out binary evolution. The relative size of the solar-composition envelope to helium core is expected to vary significantly with stellar mass and orbital period. This variation in structure is reflected in the oscillation mode periods for the models. Lastly, I will discuss constraints on the interior structure of J1112 from seismology.\n",2,

Schwab*,J. Schwab*,Sessioned,University of California,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Binary star systems composed of two white dwarfs are a natural outcome of stellar evolution. Angular momentum losses from gravitational wave radiation cause the binary system's orbit to shrink until the two white dwarfs merge. The final outcome of the merger depends on the masses of the white dwarfs. Some potential outcomes, such as supernova explosions, may occur during or soon after the merger. Other outcomes, which I will refer to as “long-term” outcomes, occur as the merger remnant cools and its structure adjusts to the new state created during the energetic merger.<br /><br />In my dissertation, I quantitatively explore the long-term outcomes of the mergers of two white dwarfs. I focus primarily on the formation of neutron stars via accretion-induced collapse and the formation of two types of unusual stars, the single sub-dwarf B stars (hot, core helium fusing stars) and the R Coronae Borealis stars (cool, carbon-rich giant stars). Beginning with the results from my previous simulations of the short-lived viscous disk initially present in these remnants, I use the state-of-the-art MESA stellar evolution code to follow their thermal evolution.<br /><br />This work improves the quantitative understanding of which white dwarf binaries lead to a particular outcome and better characterizes the observational signatures of these outcomes. For systems that will undergo accretion-induced collapse, these simulations yield improved progenitor models that can then be used to explore the collapse and formation of a neutron star.\n",3,

This magnetism affects measurements of fundamental stellar parameters, such as radius and temperature, leading to inaccurate mass and age estimates. In order to better determine stellar parameters, we aim to understand how magnetically-suppressed convection presents as cool regions across the stellar surface. In the standard ""spot paradigm"" of localized starspots blemishing an otherwise featureless surface, we use precision <i>Kepler</i> data and light curve inversion to study stellar differential rotation and starspot evolution.  Contrastingly, by imaging interferometric data collected with the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC) at GSU's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array, we detect large-scale magnetic structures across the surface of ζ Andromedae. These global regions of suppressed convection cover a large fraction of the surface, likely changing the atmospheric structure of the photosphere and impacting stellar parameter estimates. The large-scale features are at best ambiguous to interpret via established techniques that rely on rotational modulation of spots (e.g. light curve inversion and Doppler imaging). We seek to identify a class of targets where the ""spot paradigm"" breaks down and gives new insights into a range of phenomena such as long-term changes in flux for active stars, anomalous proper motion of spots derived from precision photometry, and the nature of the stellar dynamo of stars with large convective envelopes.\n",6,

Naoz*,Sessioned,UCLA,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Many observed triple systems in our Universe are in a hierarchical configuration: two objects orbit each other in a relatively tight inner binary while the third object is on a much wider orbit. Furthermore, the secular approximation for the evolution of hierarchical triple body systems has been proven to be very useful in many astrophysical contexts, from planetary to triple-star systems and even black holes. In this approximation the orbits may change shape and orientation, on timescales longer than the orbital periods, but the semi-major axes are constant. In early studies of hierarchical secular three-body systems (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962), the wider orbit was set to be circular and one of the tight binary members was assumed to be a test (massless) particle. In this situation, the component of the tight orbit’s angular momentum along the total angular momentum is conserved, and the lowest order of the approximation (i.e., the quadrupole approximation) is valid. I will discussed recent developments that showed that considering systems beyond the test particle approximation, or circular orbits, requires the next level of approximation for a correct representation of the physics, called the octupole-level. This leads to qualitative different behavior of the system. In this case, the angular momenta component of the tight and wide orbits along the total angular momentum is not conserved. Most interestingly, at this level of approximation, for an eccentric wide orbit, the tight orbit can reach extremely high eccentricities and undergo chaotic flips of its orientation. This behavior has important implications to the evolution of many systems, and I will present some nominal examples, such as retrograde hot Jupiters, blue stragglers and low-mass X-ray binaries.\n",1,

Using Chandra and HST observations, we have discovered six galaxies that host either dual AGN or offset AGN. These galaxies have two stellar bulges visible in the HST images, and the Chandra observations reveal which bulges host AGN. We find that most of the dual and offset AGN are created in major mergers of galaxies, and that these AGN are 10 times more luminous than single AGN that are not in mergers. This is observational support of the theoretical prediction that the most luminous AGN are triggered in major mergers. We also find that the AGN in the less massive stellar bulge accretes at a higher Eddington ratio than the AGN in the more massive stellar bulge, which is an effect reproduced by simulations of AGN triggering during galaxy mergers.\n",3,

Simmons,Sessioned,University of Oxford,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Two open issues in modern astrophysics are: (i) how do galaxies fully quench their star formation and (ii) how is this affected - or not - by AGN feedback? I present the results of a new Bayesian-MCMC analysis of the star formation histories of over 126,000 galaxies across the colour magnitude diagram showing that diverse quenching mechanisms are instrumental in the formation of the present day red sequence. Using classifications from Galaxy Zoo we show that the rate at which quenching can occur is morphologically dependent in each of the blue cloud, green valley and red sequence. We discuss the nature of these possible quenching mechanisms, considering the influence of secular evolution, galaxy interactions and mergers, both with and without black hole activity. We focus particularly on the relationship between these quenched star formation histories and the presence of an AGN by using this new Bayesian method to show a population of type 2 AGN host galaxies have recently (within 2 Gyr) undergone a rapid (τ < 1 Gyr) drop in their star formation rate. With this result we therefore present the first statistically supported observational evidence that AGN feedback is an important mechanism for the cessation of star formation in this population of galaxies. The diversity of this new method also highlights that such rapid quenching histories cannot account fully for all the quenching across the current AGN host population. We demonstrate that slower (τ > 2 Gyr) quenching rates dominate for high stellar mass (log<sub>10</sub>[M<sub>*</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>] > 10.75) hosts of AGN with both early- and late-type morphology.

Whitaker*,Sessioned,UMass Amherst,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): <br />It is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relation between their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*), the “star formation sequence,” and (2) the SFRs of galaxies correlate with their structure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescent galaxies at fixed mass. In this talk, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sérsic indices, n, of galaxies across the SFR-M* plane.  Using a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 2.5 selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, we find that the scatter of the star formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatter due to variations in n at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from 0.14 ± 0.02 dex at z ∼ 2 to 0.30 ± 0.04 dex at z < 1. While the slope of the log(SFR)-log(M*) relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with n > 2 (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower SFR/M* than the main ridgeline of the star formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive z ∼ 2 galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At z < 1, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M*, decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star formation sequence.\n",1,

Giavalisco,Sessioned,University of Massachusetts at Amherst,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Using CANDELS in the GOODS-North and South field, we investigate how galaxies quench their star formations and evolve on the SFR-M* plane at 1<z<3. With an improved SED fitting technique, we are able to obtain more accurate stellar mass and SFR by testing various star formation histories (SFH) for each galaxy, not just commonly used tau model. We show that galaxies are apparently separated in four different populations: starbursts which lie above the main sequence of star formation (MS), normal star-forming galaxies on the tight MS, galaxies below the MS with a little star-forming activity, and quiescent galaxies with different time evolutions of SFR. We constrain the slope and the scatter on the MS better at 1<z<3. MS slope cannot be explained by a single power-law and becomes flatter at log(M*)>10.5, indicating that star formation efficiency decreases at high masses. We study morphologies of galaxies using non-parametric (Sersic Index) and parametric measures as well as a projected mass surface density. We find that the average morphologies of SB galaxies are disky and generally have much more diffuse optical light profile than massive compact early-type galaxies (ETGs). The sizes of the SB galaxies are clearly larger than those of the MS galaxies on average. Using a projected mass surface density, more distinct morphological differences are shown among different galaxy populations. As star formation activities decrease, galaxies become more compact at all explored redshifts. The morphologies of galaxies below the MS are similar to those of quiescent galaxies, which are compact and mostly have steep optical light profiles.  The existence of compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) supports the idea that galaxies quench their star formations as they increase the core-growth in SFGs. Very compact SB galaxies are rather rare. Our morphological analysis is not consistent with the dissipative mechanism that gas-rich merging is the key driver to assemble very compact, massive early-type galaxies observed at z~2.\n",2,

J. Gawiser*,E. J. Gawiser*; P. Kurczynski; V. Acquaviva,Sessioned,Rutgers University; CUNY NYC College of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In star-forming galaxies across cosmic time, a correlation has been found between the mass of stars already assembled and its time derivative, the star formation rate.  This surprising correlation was not predicted by theory, but it can be reproduced within cosmological hydrodynamics simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.  Here we use SpeedyMC, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for Spectral Energy Distribution fitting, to measure the star formation rates and stellar masses of 800 galaxies from the Ultraviolet Ultradeep Field (UVUDF) and CANDELS/GOODS-S field at redshift 1 < z < 1.5.  This galaxy sample leverages the deepest images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to  extend the SFR-M* correlation a factor of 10-100X lower in M* than previous studies, down to values of 10^7 M_sun comparable to present-day dwarf galaxies.  Accounting for each galaxy’s parameter uncertainties, including their covariances, yields a power-law correlation across three decades with intrinsic scatter of 0.2 dex.  Having assumed realistic star formation histories that can rise and fall with time, we are able to measure star formation rates on timescales varying from instantaneous to the ""lifetime"" average for each galaxy. As the timescale over which star formation rate is averaged increases, the power-law exponent of the correlation with stellar mass increases to unity, and the scatter decreases to 0.05 dex.  We conclude that the observed correlation between star formation rate and stellar mass results from a tight correlation between recent and lifetime-average star formation rates and a narrow spread of galaxy ages at a given star formation rate. The resulting correlation provides crucial evidence that galaxy formation proceeds through self-regulated star formation.  <br /><br />We gratefully acknowledge support from NSF grant AST-1055919 and grants from NASA via the Space Telescope Science Institute in support of programs 12060.57, 12445.56, and GO-12534.\n",4,

To search for the faint galaxies, we use the power of strong gravitational lensing from foreground galaxy clusters to boost the detection limits of HST to much fainter luminosities. Using the WFC3/UVIS on board the HST, we obtain deep UV images of 4 lensing clusters with existing deep optical and near-infrared data (three from Frontier Fields survey). Building multiband photometric catalogs and applying a photometric redshift selection, we uncover a large population of dwarf galaxies (-18.5<M<sub>UV<-</sub>12.5) with small stellar masses (M*<10^9) at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation (1<z<3). Running a Monte Carlo simulation to correct for sample incompleteness and then using a Bayesian maximum likelihood technique, we demonstrate that the number density (LF) of star-forming galaxies keeps increasing steeply toward very faint magnitudes (M<sub>UV</sub>=-12.5). As an important implication of a steep faint-end slope LF, we show that the faint galaxies (-18.5<M<sub>UV</sub><-12.5) produce a large fraction of UV background (>50%) at these redshifts. We use this unique sample to investigate further the various properties of dwarf galaxies as it is claimed to deviate from the trends seen for the more massive galaxies. Recent hydro-dynamical simulations and observations of local dwarfs show that these galaxies have episodic bursts of star formation on short time scales (< 10 Myr). We find that the bursty star formation histories (SFHs) cause a large intrinsic scatter in UV colors (β) at M<sub>UV </sub>> -16, comparing a sample of low mass galaxies from simulations with bursty SFHs with our comprehensive measurements of the observed β values. As this scatter can also be due to the dust extinction, we distinguish these two effects by measuring the dust attenuation using Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ) ratios from our MOSFIRE/Keck spectroscopy.\n",5,

Dust enshrouds  and obscures UV star formation, convoluting our understanding of galaxy evolution at high redshift.   Recent literature has recognized how the inferred physical properties of distant galaxies can be influenced by the non-universality of their attenuation curve shape.   In this talk, I will present a Bayesian method to quantitatively constrain the dust-attenuation curve in high-redshift star-forming galaxies.   This method is tested on galaxies at z~2 where we have CANDELS UV-to-optical photometry and Spitzer/Herschel IR luminosities.   We find that the dust law implied from using only UV/optical data to calculate the full posterior probability densities supports the observed IR luminosities as predicted by that dust law.   This method shows promise to deduce the shape of the attenuation curve at higher redshifts (z>4), as supported by our experiments using mock data from a semi-analytic model with qualities like those of the CANDELS GOODS fields.\n",6,

The missing baryons could be accounted for if this density distribution extends to about three virial radii.

Richards*,Sessioned,Indiana University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Understanding the role and significance of dark matter in the evolution of baryonic components (i.e., conversion of the gaseous disk into stars) is a critical aspect for realistic models of galaxy evolution. In an effort to address fundamental questions regarding the growth and distribution of stellar disks in dark matter halos in a statistical manner, we have undertaken a project correlating structural properties and star formation activity with the dark matter properties of the host galaxy. The project uses a statistical sample of 45 nearby galaxies which are optimally suited for rotation curve decomposition analysis. The dataset includes deep Spitzer 3.6μm images to trace the stellar distribution, neutral and ionized gas rotation curves to trace the total mass distribution, and optical images to examine the dominant stellar populations. Using a sub-set of galaxies from the full sample, we find that the distribution of the baryonic mass relative to the total mass is roughly self-similar in more massive galaxies when normalized by the average stellar disk scale length measured at 3.6μm. We additionally observe an emerging trend between total baryonic mass and the radius at which the total mass distribution transitions from baryon-dominated to dark matter-dominated. However, we find no significant correlation between the distribution of dark matter and structural properties of the stellar disk, such as changes in color or star formation activity.\n",2,

X-ray emission from XRBs may be responsible for significant amounts of heating of the early Intergalactic Medium at Cosmic Dawn and may also play a significant role in reionization. Until recently, the hard emission from these populations could only be studied for XRBs in our own galaxy, where it is often difficult to measure accurate distances and thus luminosities. The launch of <i>NuSTAR</i>, the first focusing hard X-ray observatory, has allowed us to resolve the brightest XRBs (down to L<sub>X</sub> ~ few times 10<sup>38</sup> erg/s) in galaxies like NGC 253, M83, and M82 up to 4 Mpc away.

We performed the decompositions in g and r-bands by utilizing GALFIT software. We have derived the color of bulges and found that bulge color is redder than galaxy color and most of bulges (B/T > 0.2) show almost constant (g-r) colors regardless of their size. We also investigated the scaling relations (Kormendy and Faber-Jackson relations), which ellipticals are generally known to follow, for all of our sample bulges. Specifically, we have found that low B/T (0.1<B/T<0.3) bulges show the largest difference in the slope of the Kormendy relation from that of ellipticals. The differences become gradually smaller as bulges are larger. The Faber-Jackson relation on our bulges shows that low B/T bulges seem to have lower slopes than high B/T bulges do, approximately by a factor of 1.5, by being located below the well-known relation (i.e., the exponent of 4). Bulges on the Fundamental Plane basically appear to lie on the same plane while the noticeable tilt of the plane has been found for low B/T bulges. We have examined the effect of young stellar population on the tilt with Hβ absorption line strengths and found that a significant tilt (at least more than ~ 30 % of the tilt) mainly arises from the effect of young stellar population in bulges. This implies that bulges are basically virialized systems irrespective of their size and thus the scatters about the scaling relations are a result of the presence of young stellar population preferentially in low B/T bulges. Drawn from our results, bulges seem very similar to ellipticals, although they are thought to be formed through the different formation mechanisms.\n",8,

At these high energies, stellar activity can dramatically impact the observations.

The mass of Kepler-78b has been independently reported by two teams based on radial velocity (RV) measurements using the HIRES and HARPS-N spectrographs. Due to the active nature of the host star, a stellar activity model is required to distinguish and isolate the planetary signal in RV data. Whereas previous studies tested parametric stellar activity models, we modeled this system using nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) regression. We produced a GP regression of relevant Kepler photometry. We then use the posterior parameter distribution for our photometric fit as a prior for our simultaneous GP + Keplerian orbit models of the RV data sets. We tested three simple kernel functions for our GP regressions. Based on a Bayesian likelihood analysis, we selected a quasi-periodic kernel model with GP hyperparameters coupled between the two RV data sets, giving a Doppler amplitude of 1.86 ± 0.25 m s<sup>-1</sup> and supporting our belief that the correlated noise we are modeling is astrophysical. The corresponding mass of 1.87<sub>-0.26</sub><sup>+0.27</sup> M<sub>E </sub>is consistent with that measured in previous studies, and more robust due to our nonparametric signal estimation.

Kane*,M. Kane*; D. Ragozzine; T. Holczer; T. Mazeh; J. Rowe,Sessioned,Florida Institute of Technology; Tel Aviv University; NASA Ames Research Center,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope is designed to find extrasolar planets by watching a section of the sky and observing if an object transits in front its parent star. By noticing the dimming and brightening of the star as a prospective transit occurs, Kepler records the times when the planet moves in front of its star. If other planets are gravitationally influencing the transiting planet, the planet might transit late or early; these deviations from a perfectly periodic set of transits are called “transit timing variations (TTVs). Therefore, Kepler TTVs are useful in determining exoplanet masses which are hard to measure in other ways.<br />We decided to visually analyze the TTV data of all ~6000 Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) to determine whether interesting TTV signals would be missed by purely statistical analyses. Using data from Rowe et al. 2014 and Holczer et al. 2015, submitted, we created combined TTV plots, periodigrams, and folded quadratic+sinusoid fits. The raw TTV data and ancillary plots were visually inspected for each of the ~6000 KOIs. To find the most likely KOIs containing visible TTVs and to organize the over 6000 KOIs analyzed, a rating system was developed based on numerous visual factors. These rating factors include the amount of outliers, if there is a clear sinusoidal period within the folded plots, and if there is a clear peak in the periodigram. By sorting KOIs as such, we were able to compare our findings of the strongest candidates with the same KOIs statistically analyzed by Holczer et al. 2015 (submitted, see also Mazeh et al. 2013).<br />It was found that the majority of our findings matched those of Holczer et al. 2015, with only small discrepancies that were understandable based on our different methodologies. Our visual inspection of the full list of KOIs contributed multiple systems that were not included in the initial list of KOIs with significant TTVs identified statistically.\n",3,

This relationship can best be probed using mass measurements of transiting exoplanets—which allow for robust estimates of planet size relative to the host star.  Radial Velocity (RV) and Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are the two primary means to measure planetary masses.  However, early comparisons of these two methods show a difference in their respective populations of measured planet densities.  Using analytic modeling and Monte Carlo simulations I show how much, if not all, of the difference can be attibuted to how the signal-to-noise depends upon planet size, mass, and orbital period.  I find that for the smallest-sized planets, TTVs are likely to provide a more accurate mass radius relationship as an increasing number of planetary systems are studied.\n",4,

In a previous analysis of the <i>Kepler</i> data set, we found that planets orbiting early M dwarfs are common: we measured a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.45 +/- 0.22 planets per M dwarf with periods of 0.5-200 days and planet radii of 1-4 Earth radii. Within a conservative habitable zone based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimated an occurrence rate of 0.15 (+0.18/-0.06) Earth-size planets and 0.09 (+0.10/-0.04) super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Applying these occurrence rates to the population of nearby stars and assuming that mid- and late-M dwarfs host planets at the same rate as early M dwarfs, we predicted that the nearest potentially habitable Earth-size planet likely orbits an M dwarf a mere 2.6 ± 0.4 pc away. We are now testing the assumption of equal planet occurrence rates for M dwarfs of all types by inspecting the population of planets detected by K2 and conducting follow-up observations of planet candidate host stars to identify false positives and better constrain system parameters. I will present the results of recent observing runs with SpeX on the IRTF to obtain near-infrared spectra of low-mass stars targeted by K2 and determine the radii, temperatures, and metallicities of our target stars using empirical relations.

Their result implies that these free-floating planet candidates may constitute an overwhelming fraction of the mass budget for planet formation. K2's Campaign 9 (K2C9) will conduct a ~4 square-degree microlensing survey toward the Galactic bulge and is our first and potentially <i>only</i> opportunity to perform a synoptic survey to measure the masses of a substantial number of short-timescale events. The ∼0.5 AU baseline between K2 and the Earth during C9 will facilitate satellite parallax measurements for short-timescale events, with durations of ∼1 day, which will identify that the cause of the event is in fact a very low-mass object, i.e., a free-floating planet candidate. By taking near-infrared (NIR) photometry during the event and comparing to high-resolution NIR photometry after the event is over, we can then distinguish between a planet that is widely separated from but gravitationally bound to a host star and one that is truly free-floating. Here we overview this procedure, describe the resources available to accomplish it, and detail the expected yields.\n",9,

Our sample includes 22 groups at distances between 70-160 Mpc over the mass range 12.5 < log M/M<sub>⊙</sub> < 15.0, for a total of 1986 late-type galaxies out to a projected group-centric distance of 4.0 Mpc. We find that late-type galaxies in the centers of groups lack HI at fixed stellar mass relative to the regions surrounding them. Larger groups show evidence of a stronger gradient in HI properties, despite a similar gradient in stellar mass, and in color at fixed stellar mass, over the same range in r/R<sub>200</sub>. We compare several environment variables to determine which is the best predictor of galaxy properties; group-centric distance r and r/R<sub>200</sub> are similarly effective predictors, while local density is slightly more effective and group size and halo mass are slightly less effective. Finally, we see evidence that HI is deficient for blue cloud galaxies in denser environments even when both stellar mass and color are fixed. This is consistent with a picture where HI is removed or destroyed, followed by reddening within the blue cloud. Overall, our results support the existence of pre-processing in isolated groups, along with an additional rapid mechanism for gas removal within larger groups and clusters, perhaps by ram-pressure stripping.

It is bounded by voids both between Laniakea and PPS and beyond PPS. Within this box, the 70% ALFALFA survey has detected 4,800 galaxies within cz = 8,000 km/s. Of these, 80% have masses greater than 10<sup>8</sup><sup> </sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>. At the distance of the PPS, galaxies with M<sub>HI</sub> ≤ 10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> are below the ALFALFA detection limit. Thus to further explore this rich diversity of galaxy environments and the adjoining voids, the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team is in the process of using the L-band Wide receiver at Arecibo Observatory for the Arecibo Pisces-Perseus Supercluster Survey (APPSS). We will observe galaxies with 10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> ≤ M<sub>HI</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> chosen from the SDSS DR12 and GALEX catalogs. We are limiting our observations to the PPS ridge in 21<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> to 3<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup> and 23° to 35°. Since this region lacks SDSS spectroscopy, targets have been selected using photometric criteria derived from SDSS and GALEX observations for galaxies detected by ALFALFA. The results of these observations will allow us to constrain the HI mass function along the PPS ridge. Application of the Tully-Fisher relation will allow a robust measure of the infall velocities of galaxies into the filament. This work has been supported by NSF grant AST-1211005.\n",2,

How its form varies throughout the local Universe and as a function of redshift, is key to developing a complete picture of galaxy evolution.<br /><br />We use the ALFALFA 70% catalog, the largest uniform catalog of extragalactic HI sources to date, to explore the environmental dependence of the HI mass function based on the projected neighbour densities in both SDSS and 2MRS. The Schechter function 'knee' mass is found to increase by approximately 0.2 dex from the lowest to highest density quartiles. However, this dependence is seen only when environment is defined by SDSS neighbours, and not with 2MRS. We interpret this as an indication of local, rather than large scale, environmental depedence. In addition, we find no evidence for any change in the faint-end slope; which is a source of tension with HI surveys of galaxy groups, and DM halo simulations.<br /><br />As HI surveys push deeper in an attempt to assess the HI content of the Universe towards a redshift of order unity, only the integral of the HI mass function will be measurable through stacking. We present an anaytic, and thus computationally cheap, method to estimate the contribution of HI confusion noise to these stacks and explore the design implications for upcoming SKA-precusor surveys.<br /><br />The ALFALFA team at Cornell is supported by NSF grants AST-0607007 and AST-1107390 to RG and MPH and by grants from the Brinson Foundation.\n",3,

The composition of these tails has remained a mystery, as previous studies have focused on detecting tidal features, rather than the composite material itself. We have developed an observing program using deep, multiband imaging to probe the chaotic regions of tidal tails in search for an underlying stellar population. NGC 3256's twin tidal tails serve as a case study for this new technique. Our results show color values of <i>u - g</i> = 1.15 and <i>r - i</i> = 0.08 for the Western tail, and <i>u - g</i> = 1.33 and <i>r - i </i>= 0.22 for the Eastern tail, corresponding to discrepant ages between the tails of approximately 320 Myr and 785 Myr, respectively. With the interaction age of the system measured at 400 Myr, we find the stellar light in Western tail to be dominated by disrupted star clusters formed during and after the interaction, whereas the light from the Eastern tail is dominated by a 10 Gyr population originating from the host galaxies. We fit the Eastern tail color to a Mixed Stellar Population (MSP) model comprised 94% by mass of a 10 Gyr stellar population, and 6% of a 309 Myr population. We find 52% of the bolometric flux originating from this 10 Gyr population. We also detect a blue to red color gradient in each tail, running from galactic center to tail tip. In addition to tidal tail light, we detect 29 star cluster candidates (SCCs) in the Western tail and 19 in the Eastern, with mean ages of 282 Myr and 98 Myr respectively. Interestingly, we find an excess of very blue SCCs in the Eastern tail as compared to the Western tail, marking a recent, small episode of star formation.\n",7,

Over eight years of field notes, observations, and interviews with cultural leaders, historians, and ho`okele wa`a (navigators) were used to construct and validate Kilohoku Ho`okele Wa`a, the Astronomy of the Hawaiian Navigators. In contrast to the various historical sky maps designed by different practitioners and local groups in pre-colonial times, this sky-map depicts the four whole-sky constellations used by present day wayfinders. Designed by a loosely bound group of cultural leaders and navigators as a tool to use in modern non-instrumental navigation, Kilohoku Ho`okele Wa`a is a pragmatic fusion of ancient Hawaiian tradition, traditions of greater Polynesia, and modern-day Indigenous cultural forces. Like a very small number of cultures who use the sky for non-instrumental navigation, the ho`okele wa`a conceive of each season’s visible sky as a whole image, using a single constellation that stretches from the northern to the southern horizon as a tool that facilitates direction finding in skies that are often very cloudy, and that chunks the sky into sections that decrease the cognitive load placed on the navigator. Moving through the seasons, beginning in Winter, Na `Ohana Hoku `Eha (The Four Star Families) are Kekaomakali`I (The Bailer), Kaiwikuamo`o (The Backbone), Manaiakalani (The Fishhook), and Kalupekawelo (The Kite).

Tenn*,Sessioned,Sonoma State Univ.,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Although it is not yet visible, much progress has been made on the Astronomy Genealogy Project (AstroGen) since it was accepted as a project of the Historical Astronomy Division (HAD) three years ago. AstroGen will list the world’s astronomers with information about their highest degrees and advisors. (In academic genealogy, your thesis advisor is your parent.) A small group (the AstroGen Team) has compiled a database of approximately 12,000 individuals who have earned doctorates with theses (dissertations) on topics in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, or planetary science. These include nearly all those submitted in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and most of those in the United States (all through 2014 for most universities and all through 1990 for all). We are compiling more information than is maintained by the Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP). In addition to name, degree, university, year of degree, and thesis advisor(s), all provided by MGP as well, we are including years of birth and death when available, mentors in addition to advisors, and links to the thesis when it is online and to the person’s web page or obituary, when we can find it. We are still struggling with some questions, such as the boundaries of inclusion and whether or not to include subfields of astronomy. We believe that AstroGen will be a valuable resource for historians of science as well as a source of entertainment for those who like to look up their academic family trees. A dedicated researcher following links from AstroGen will be able to learn quite a lot about the careers of astronomy graduates of a particular university, country, or era. We are still seeking volunteers to enter the graduates of one or more universities.\n",5,

J. Dick*,S. J. Dick*,Sessioned,NASA,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Although the philosophy of science and of specific sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology are well-developed fields with their own books and journals, the philosophy of astronomy and cosmology have received little systematic attention. At least six categories of problems may be identified in the astronomical context: 1) the nature of reasoning, including the roles of observation, theory, simulation, and analogy, as well as the limits of reasoning, starkly evident in the anthropic principle, fine-tuning, and multiverse controversies; 2) the often problematic nature of evidence and inference, especially since the objects of astronomical interest are for the most part beyond experiment and experience;3) the influence of metaphysical preconceptions and non-scientific worldviews on astronomy, evidenced, for example in the work of Arthur S. Eddington and many other astronomers; 4) the epistemological status of astronomy and its central concepts, including the process of discovery, the problems of classification, and the pitfalls of definition (as in planets); 5) the role of technology in shaping the discipline of astronomy and our view of the universe; and 6) the mutual interactions of astronomy and cosmology with society over time. Discussion of these issues should draw heavily on the history of astronomy as well as current research, and may reveal an evolution in approaches, techniques, and goals, perhaps with policy relevance. This endeavor should also utilize and synergize approaches and results from philosophy of science and of related sciences such as physics (e.g. discussions on the nature of space and time). Philosophers, historians and scientists should join this new endeavor. A Journal of the Philosophy of Astronomy and Cosmology (JPAC) could help focus attention on their studies.\n",6,

E. Miles*,B. E. Miles*; E. L. Shkolnik,Sessioned,UCLA; Arizona State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The likelihood of finding an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf in the near future is very high. In order to characterize such a planet’s habitability, we need to understand how much ultraviolet (UV) radiation the planet is receiving from its host star. UV light from the host star influences a planet’s atmospheric photochemistry and will affect our interpretations of measured exoplanetary atmospheric compositions from future missions like JWST and the extremely large ground-based telescopes. Time resolved UV data for a large number of stars can provide more detailed boundary conditions for atmospheric modeling and information on the activity behavior of low-mass stars. The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) provides time resolved data in the near- ultraviolet (NUV) band (1771 – 2831 Å). On average, there are 4 UV observations per M dwarf in our population of 436 M dwarfs within 25 pc of Earth. The GALEX mission has multiple surveys, which covered different sized areas of the sky. At the final data release, the All Sky Survey (AIS) covered 2/3 of the sky and accounts for 58% of our 2595 measurements. The Deep Imaging Survey (DIS), Medium Imaging Survey (MIS), Guest Investigator Survey (GII), and Nearby Galaxy Survey (NGS) contribute the remaining data. From the NUV GALEX data we find an increase in variability among later M dwarfs within the M0 – M4 range. M0 stars vary on average by 9% around their mean flux, while M4 stars vary by 31% around their mean flux.\n",1,

Linsky,Sessioned,University of Colorado,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The spectral and temporal behavior of exoplanet host stars is a critical input to models of the chemistry and evolution of planetary atmospheres. High-energy photons (X-ray to near-UV; 5 – 3200 Ang) from these stars regulate the atmospheric temperature profiles and photochemistry on orbiting planets, influencing the production of potential “biomarker” gases.  It has been shown that the atmospheric signatures of potentially habitable planets around low-mass stars may be significantly different from planets orbiting Sun-like stars owing to the different UV spectral energy distribution.   I will present results from a panchromatic survey (Hubble/Chandra/XMM/optical) of M and K dwarf exoplanet hosts, the MUSCLES Treasury Survey (Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems).   We reconstruct the Lyman-alpha and extreme-UV (100-900 Ang) radiation lost to interstellar attenuation and create 5 Angstrom to 5 micron stellar irradiance spectra; these data will be publically available as a High-Level Science Product on MAST.  We find that all low-mass exoplanet host stars exhibit significant chromospheric/transition region/coronal emission -- no “UV inactive” M dwarfs are observed.  The F(far-UV)/F(near-UV) flux ratio, a driver for possible abiotic production of the suggested biomarkers O2 and O3, increases by ~3 orders of magnitude as the habitable zone moves inward from 1 to 0.1 AU, while the incident far-UV (912 – 1700 Ang) and XUV (5 – 900 Ang) radiation field strengths decrease by factors of a few across this range.  Far-UV flare activity is common in ‘optically inactive’ M dwarfs; statistics from the entire sample indicate that large UV flares (E(300 – 1700 Ang) >= 10^31 erg) occur several times per day on typical M dwarf exoplanet hosts. <br />\n",7,

Unfortunately, our understanding of exoplanets is most often limited by our ability to characterize the host star. My thesis has focused on this stellar characterization problem. MEarth consists of 2 arrays of 8 telescopes each, one located at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, and the other at Cerro Tololo, Chile. First, I used data from the Northern array to measure the trigonometric parallax of 1500 northern M dwarfs with a precision of 3 mas. With these distances we better characterized the MEarth M dwarfs and selected a volume-limited sample from which to search for planets. Second, I calibrated the MEarth photometric system using observations of Landolt standard fields. We measured the red-optical MEarth magnitude for 1800 M dwarfs with 1.5% precision. Combined with trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic metallicity estimates, I created a color-magnitude-metallicity relation for the mid-to-late M dwarfs capable of reproducing spectral metallicities with 0.1 dex precision. With these metallicities, we plan to measure any potential planet-metallicity correlation at the low-mass end of the stellar sequence once future missions uncover the planets orbiting these stars. Third, I present MEarth-South's discovery of a low mass eclipsing binary system. The system has an orbital period of 4.7 days, possesses zero eccentricity but is non-synchronously rotating. We obtained high precision radial velocity measurements from the TRES spectrograph, allowing us to measure the mass of each component with 1% precision. Both components are slightly inflated compared to the most recent stellar models, in keeping with previous precise mass-radius determinations for low mass stars. Fourth, I am currently gathering sloan photometry for M dwarfs to calibrate a color-color metallicity relation in the sloan bandpass.

However, the stellar wind properties and distribution are affected by the strong (~kG) dipolar magnetic fields being detected in a growing population of massive stars by the MiMeS project. In these magnetic stars the stellar wind is channeled along the closed magnetic field loops toward the magnetic equator. The wind flows from opposite hemispheres collide producing X-rays via radiative cooling. Rapidly rotating massive stars have an added centrifugal support allowing for the build up of additional material and the production of energetic X-rays. However, surveys indicate that some stars deviate from these predictions. To better understand this phenomenon, XMM Newton-EPIC and Chandra-ACIS observations were used to characterize various rapidly rotating magnetic B-type stars.

As the wind turns on itself, shocks heat the plasma to millions of degrees and produce X-ray emission. Such magnetospheres are typically classified with the “wind magnetic confinement parameter”, a simplified ratio between the magnetic energy density and the wind kinetic energy density. This parameter is often used to estimate magnetosphere properties, such as size, mass-loss rate, and spin-down time. Unfortunately, the strong magnetic fields in magnetospheres (polar strength: 100 G - 10 kG) and resulting Alfven velocities make magnetohydrodynamics simulations computationally difficult due to very small timesteps. To get around this issue, we approximate a massive-star magnetosphere as a series of one-dimensional flows along magnetic dipole field lines and develop a steady-state model from the resulting hydrodynamic equations. With this model, we derive scaling relations for the stellar mass-loss rate as a function of surface colatitude and find agreement with previous scaling results derived from simulations. These relations are further extended to include the effects of rigid-body rotation within the magnetosphere. Additionally, we develop an X-ray emission model from this steady-state analysis and compare it against both the “XADM” model for X-ray emission from massive star magnetospheres and observations of massive magnetic stars. Finally, we discuss improvements to the traditional wind magnetic confinement parameter to take into account the effect of a magnetic field on the wind kinetic energy density.\n",5,

It has been clearly demonstrated in a number of studies that SNe Ia are better distance indicators in the near-infrared compared to the optical. As exciting as these new results are, SNe Ia in the NIR are expected to be even better than these studies indicate. A key ingredient for improving SN Ia in the NIR as distance indicators is to obtain NIR spectroscopy to determine precise k-corrections, which account for the effect of cosmological expansion upon the measured magnitudes. Better knowledge of the NIR spectroscopic behaviors, akin to that in the optical, is necessary to reach the distance precision required to identify viable models for dark energy.

Dolence,Sessioned,Florida State University; Los Alamos National Lab,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We derive an integral condition for core-collapse supernova explosions and use it to construct a new diagnostic of explodability.  The fundamental challenge in core-collapse supernova theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to explode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that shock revival is initiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition for shock expansion, v<sub>s</sub> > 0. Assuming that v<sub>s</sub> > 0 corresponds to explosion, we recast this integral condition as a dimensionless condition for explosion, Ψ > 0. Using 1D simulations, we confirm that Ψ = 0 during the stalled phase and Ψ > 0 during explosion. Having validated the integral condition, we use it to derive a useful explosion diagnostic. First, for a given set of parameters, we find the family of solutions to the steady-state equations, parameterized by shock radius R<sub>s</sub>, yielding Ψ(R<sub>s</sub>).  For any particular solution, Ψ(R<sub>s</sub>) may be negative, zero, or positive, and, since Ψ ∝ v<sub>s</sub>, this corresponds to a solution with a receding, stationary, or expanding shock, respectively. Within this family, there is always a solution with a minimum Ψ, Ψ<sub>min</sub>. When Ψ<sub>min</sub> < 0, there always exists a stalled accretion shock solution, but when Ψ<sub>min</sub> > 0, all solutions have v<sub>s</sub> > 0. Therefore, Ψ<sub>min</sub> = 0 defines a critical hypersurface for explosion, and we show that the critical neutrino luminosity curve proposed by Burrows & Goshy 1993 is a projection of this more general critical condition. Finally, we propose and verify with 1D simulations that Ψ<sub>min</sub> is a reliable and accurate explosion diagnostic.\n",7,

They are generally associated with eruptive phenomena in the lower corona such as solar flares, filament eruptions, EUV waves or jets, known as low-coronal signatures (LCS).  Recent studies have observed CMEs without a LCS which have been referred to as stealth CMEs.  Through new image processing applied to EUV images we find clear evidence of LCS leading to stealth CMEs.  In this work, the new processing methods are applied to some of the data identified to contain stealth CMEs in previous studies to investigate the possible existence of observable LCS.  The LCS of stealth CMEs are fairly sizeable yet faint eruptions with structure consistent with a rising flux tube, possibly formed higher in the corona in regions of weaker magnetic field.  We believe these flux tubes are formed mostly in polar regions due to the larger shear resulting from the slowly-rotating lower atmosphere below the more rapidly rotating corona.  This would allow the formation of large flux tubes in weaker field regions, leading to low-energy and low-density flux tube eruptions.\n",3,

One of these unanswered questions is how the supersonic outflow from the Sun, the solar wind, is generated and accelerated. In this dissertation, I have investigated the role of Alfvén waves in heating the corona and accelerating the wind. I focus on modeling of flux tubes that are open to the heliosphere, i.e. bundles of magnetic field that stretch beyond a few solar radii into the heliosphere. In these flux tubes, Alfvén waves are launched by the shaking of the footpoints from the convective motions of granulation on the solar photosphere. I present results of modeling efforts in one dimension that investigate how this process changes for a variety of different magnetic field structures over a solar cycle and three-dimensional modeling of time-dependent processes that unlock a connection between pico- and nanoflare-scale events and the turbulent heating generated by counter-propagating Alfvén waves. In addition to computational modeling, I also present efforts to find magnetic thresholds in observations of small-scale network jets seen with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). These jets were first discovered by IRIS due to their short lifetimes (10s of seconds) and small size (widths of 100s of kilometers). The findings for this project suggest that the modeled Alfvén-wave-driven turbulence is consistent with these network jets.\n",4,

However, much preparatory work is needed to ensure JWST’s effective use once it is launched. One major issue is to ensure that data taken by JWST can be properly analyzed. This summer, I worked on developing methods for data analysis of simulated images of Io, Jupiter’s closest moon. These images will come from JWST’s instrument, the Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, shining brightly in the infrared during its volcanic outbursts. Currently, we observe Io with ground based telescopes, but because of atmospheric turbulence we can’t resolve volcanism on Io. This is why using JWST to observe Io’s volcanos would be extremely beneficial. The most relevant parameters are the position of volcanic eruptions, the flux of those eruptions, and the surface brightness of Io itself. Simultaneously, finding both the positional parameters of Io’s volcanoes and the flux parameters of Io’s volcanoes was inefficient. Instead, I found it best to acquire the positions of the volcanoes first, then fixing these positions to fit for the flux of the volcanoes and the brightness of Io. In addition, I found that with just an assumption of Poisson noise affecting the image, the correct fluxes and brightness could be measured within 3% error. The remaining work includes fine tuning our forward modeling procedures to reduce the error on measured parameters and accounting for other types of noise in the simulation.\n",6,

For small solid particles (e.g., dust grains) to coagulate into planetesimals, however, requires that these particles grow beyond centimeter sizes; with traditional coagulation physics, this is very difficult. The streaming instability, which is a clumping process akin to the pile-up of cars in a traffic jam, generates sufficiently high solid densities that the mutual gravity between the clumped particles eventually causes their collapse towards planetesimal mass and size scales. Exploring this transition from dust grains to planetesimals is still in its infancy but is extremely important if we want to understand the basics of planet formation. Here, I present a series of high resolution, first principles numerical simulations of protoplanetary disk gas and dust to study the clumping of particles via the streaming instability and the subsequent collapse towards planetesimals. These simulations have been employed to characterize the planetesimal population as a function of radius in protoplanetary disks.

J. Nemiroff*,R. J. Nemiroff*,Sessioned,Michigan Technological Univ.; Astrophysics Source Code Library,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The project has ended -- should all of the computer codes that enabled the project be deleted? No. Like research papers, research codes typically carry valuable information past project end dates. Several possible end states to the life of research codes are reviewed. Historically, codes are typically left dormant on an increasingly obscure local disk directory until forgotten. These codes will likely become any or all of: lost, impossible to compile and run, difficult to decipher, and likely deleted when the code's proprietor moves on or dies. It is argued here, though, that it would be better for both code authors and astronomy generally if project codes were archived after use in some way.  Archiving is advantageous for code authors because archived codes might increase the author's ADS citable publications, while astronomy as a science gains transparency and reproducibility. Paper-specific codes should be included in the publication of the journal papers they support, just like figures and tables. General codes that support multiple papers, possibly written by multiple authors, including their supporting websites, should be registered with a code registry such as the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL). Codes developed on GitHub can be archived with a third party service such as, currently, BackHub. An important code version might be uploaded to a web archiving service like, currently, Zenodo or Figshare, so that this version receives a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), enabling it to found at a stable address into the future. Similar archiving services that are not DOI-dependent include perma.cc and the Internet Archive Wayback Machine at archive.org.  Perhaps most simply, copies of important codes with lasting value might be kept on a cloud service like, for example, Google Drive, while activating Google's Inactive Account Manager.\n",6,

The National Science Foundation is playing a critical role in supporting, stimulating, and shaping these advances. NSF is more than an agency of government or a funding mechanism for the infrastructure of science. The work of NSF is a sacred trust that every generation of Americans makes to those of the next generation, that we will build on the body of knowledge we inherit and continue to push forward the frontiers of science. We never lose sight of NSF’s obligation to ""explore the unexplored"" and inspire all of humanity with the wonders of discovery. As the only Federal agency dedicated to the support of basic research and education in all fields of science and engineering, NSF has empowered discoveries across a broad spectrum of scientific inquiry for more than six decades. The result is fundamental scientific research that has had a profound impact on our nation's innovation ecosystem and kept our nation at the very forefront of the world's science-and-engineering enterprise.\n",1,

It is therefore suggested that a mechanism be created for established astronomers to voluntarily will 10 percent of their estate to a fund that helps aspiring astronomers reduce child care costs. Statistics indicate that many scientists delay child rearing until they have secure jobs. This delay appears to be based on the early relative cost of child care and the perception that time spent raising children negatively impacts job performance and future employability. Having even a portion of child care expenses covered may increase the efficiency of early-career education and productivity of early-career scientific research. It is hoped that some established astronomers may be inspired to contribute by remembering their own lives as aspiring astronomers, while also wishing to add to their legacy. Only an expression of interest is requested here, both from established astronomers who might be interested in taking such a donation pledge, and from aspiring astronomers who feel their careers would be helped by child care assistance.\n",1,

What would you do? Would you report it? Or would you decide, after a few other instances of harassment, that maybe you shouldn't pursue astronomy? Harassment is under-reported, the policies can be difficult to understand or hard to find, and it can be very intimidating as a young scientist to report it to the proper individuals. The Astronomy Allies Program is designed to help you with these sorts of problems. We are a group of volunteers that will help by doing the following: provide safe walks home during the conference, someone to talk to confidentially, as an intervener, as a resource to report harassment. The Allies are a diverse group of scientists committed to acting as mentors, advocates, and liaisons. The Winter 2015 AAS meeting was the first meeting that had Astronomy Allies, and Astronomy Allies provided a website for information, as well as a twitter, email, and phone number for anyone who needs our help or would like more information. We posted about the Astronomy Allies on the Women In Astronomy blog, and this program resonates with many people: either they want to help, or they have experienced harassment in the past and don't want to see it in the future. Harassment may not happen to most conference participants, but it's wrong, it's against the AAS anti-harassment policy ( http://aas.org/policies/anti-harassment-policy ), it can be very damaging, and if it happens to even one person, that is unacceptable. We intend to improve the culture at conferences to make it so that harassers feel they can't get away with their unprofessional behavior.\n",2,

Barron*,D. Barron*,Sessioned,UC Berkeley,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): POLARBEAR is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. The science goals of the POLARBEAR project are to do a deep search for CMB B-mode polarization created by inflationary gravitational waves, as well as characterize the CMB B-mode signal from gravitational lensing. POLARBEAR-1 started observations in 2012. The POLARBEAR team has published results from its first season of observations on a small fraction of the sky, including a measurement of a non-zero B-mode polarization angular power spectrum at sub-degree scales, where the dominant signal is gravitational lensing of the CMB. Improving these measurements requires precision characterization of the CMB polarization signal over large fractions of the sky, at multiple frequencies. To achieve these goals, POLARBEAR has begun expanding to include an additional two 3.5 meter telescopes with multi-chroic receivers, known as the Simons Array. With high sensitivity and large sky coverage, the Simons Array will create a detailed survey of B-mode polarization, and its spectral information will be used to extract the CMB signal from astrophysical foregrounds. The Simons Array data will place strong constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, when combined with data from the next generation of baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. We present the status of this funded instrument and its expected capabilities.\n",2,

Leonard*,K. Leonard*; A. de Gouvêa,Sessioned,University of Texas at Austin; Northwestern University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): It is now well accepted that neutrinos oscillate as a quantum mechanical result of a misalignment between their mass-eigenstates and the flavor-eigenstates. We study neutrino decay—the idea that there may be new, light states that the three Standard Model flavors may be able to decay into. We consider what effects this neutrino decay would have on the observed oscillation probabilities.<br /><br />The Hamiltonian governs how the states change with time, so we use it to calculate an oscillation amplitude, and from that, the oscillation probability. We simplify the theoretical probabilities using results from experimental data, such as the neutrino mixing angles and mass differences. By exploring what values of the decay parameters are physically allowable, we can begin to understand just how large the decay parameters can be. We compare the probabilities in the case of no neutrino decay and in the case of maximum neutrino decay to determine how much of an effect neutrino decay could have on observations, and discuss the ability of future experiments to detect these differences.<br /><br />We also examine neutrino decay in the realm of CP invariance, and found that it is a new source of CP violation. Our work indicates that there is a difference in the oscillation probabilities between particle transitions and their corresponding antiparticle transitions. If neutrino decay were proven true, it could be an important factor in understanding leptogenesis and the particle-antiparticle asymmetry present in our Universe.\n",4,

Since luminosity depends on disk inclination angle, there is a discrepancy between a galaxy’s apparent luminosity and its intrinsic luminosity. Thus, the observed properties of galaxies can be different from their intrinsic (inclination-independent) properties. We use a sample of ~1 million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that have mass estimates and disk+bulge component fits from the literature to study the dependence of galaxy luminosity on inclination. We identify mass-to-light ratio (M/L) dependence on inclination to correct luminosities (and confirm that galaxies with corrected luminosities have colors that are inclination independent) to create an intrinsic sample. With this sample we can investigate the luminosity function, the distribution of the bulge-to-disk ratios, and other galaxy properties. Inclination independent measurements of these parameters will give a better understanding of how galaxies form and evolve.\n",6,

Storey-Fisher*,K. Storey-Fisher*; A. Maller,Sessioned,Brown University; American Museum of Natural History; The New York City College of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The masses of dark matter (DM) halos in cosmological simulations are often assumed to correlate directly with the stellar mass of galaxies. However, these halos are defined differently; there is no single widely-accepted denition of the mass of a DM halo. Thus, in some cases this assumption may not be valid. We present a comparison of common methods of defining dark matter halo mass in order to determine which functions best for the purpose of correlating halos to galaxies. We analyze a simulation that was run using the cosmological hydrodynamical code RAMSES, containing dark matter and gas. In order to avoid the irrelevant complexities of feedback, star formation is inhibited by introducing articial pressure at a certain density to support the cold dense gas. This allows us to isolate the star-forming gas and analyze how this gas mass scales with halo mass. We compare using the total dark matter mass to including only bound dark matter particles, and we test various common denitions of the halo radius, such as R200, R500, Rvir, etc. We determine that using the total dark matter mass produces halos with a star-forming gas fraction significantly closer to the cosmic baryon fraction, Omega_b/Omega_dm, compared with using only bound particles. We find that Rvir produces halos in which the fraction of star-forming gas to dark matter correlates most closely with Omega_b/Omega_dm, giving a mean difference of less than 1%. This is important for populating halos in dark matter-only simulations with galaxies, so that Omega_b/Omega_dm can be used to determine the gas and stellar mass from the host halo's DM mass. We conclude that of the commonly used halo mass definitions, Rvir using the total DM mass gives the most accurate results in simulation analyses, though a better definition may be possible and necessary.\n",7,

We search for these effects by using data from recent cosmological analyses to greatly increase the SN Ia sample; we include 179 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the JLA and Pan-STARRS SN Ia cosmology samples and 157 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the Riess et al. (2011) H<sub>0</sub> measurement. We find little evidence that SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments are fainter after light curve correction than SNe Ia in locally passive environments. We find a difference of only 0.000±0.018 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with SALT2 and 0.029±0.027 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with MLCS2k2 (R<sub>V</sub> = 2.5), which suggests that proposed changes to recent measurements of H<sub>0</sub> and <i>w</i> are not significant and numerically smaller than the parameter measurement uncertainties. We find that both populations have more similar dispersion in distance than found by Rigault et al. (2013), Rigault et al. (2015), and Kelly et al. (2015). The greatly reduced significance of these distance modulus differences compared to Rigault et al. (2013) and Rigault et al. (2015) result from two improvements with fairly equal effects, our larger sample size and the use of JLA and Riess et al. (2011) sample selection criteria.

Doing so will require accurate distance estimates to billions of faint galaxies, meaning that photo-z's will be essential for the ultimate scientific success of these missions. Because galaxy colors drive photo-z estimates, spectroscopic calibration samples must <i>at least</i> be representative in color. Here we present a technique, based on the <i>self-organizing map </i>(Kohonen 1990), to map the empirical distribution of galaxies in the high-dimensional color space of a given survey. We apply the technique to <i>Euclid</i>-like data for ~131k galaxies from the COSMOS survey, allowing us to determine where – in galaxy color space – spectroscopic coverage exists and where it is systematically missing. We show that the mapping technique lets us develop efficient spectroscopic sampling strategies to measure the color-redshift relation by focusing effort on poorly constrained regions of multicolor space. We discuss the nature of the galaxies in un-sampled regions of galaxy color space, and show that a fiducial survey with Keck (making use of LRIS, DEIMOS, and MOSFIRE) could meet the <i>Euclid</i> calibration requirements in ~40 nights of observing.\n",14,

R. Claytor*,Z. R. Claytor*,Sessioned,Ohio Wesleyan University; California Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): High redshift (very distant) galaxy surveys record broad-band photometry for billions of galaxies in order to measure distances in a faster, more cost-effective way than spectroscopy. Knowing these distances (more specifically, the redshifts) helps cosmologists learn more about the early universe and how it evolved, but calibrating the redshifts from photometry requires a color-selection technique. One such technique is the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a machine-learning algorithm that projects high-dimensional photometry data onto a visual, two-dimensional map. High-redshift galaxies can be identified efficiently in such a mapping. However, there is a chance that high-redshift galaxies are lost to low-redshift regions and vice versa due to photometric error; this effect was analyzed. A Monte Carlo simulation was run on objects selected from along the boundary between high- and low-redshift regions. Roughly 18% of selected objects scattered from high- to low-redshift, and about 16% scattered the other way. Further research will design a better metric of the scattering percentages based on the number density of galaxies in the map, and future work should use these analysis techniques on other high-redshift data.\n",15,

Until the advent of ALMA, however, the molecular gas fueling the prodigious star formation in blue compact dwarfs was difficult to observe because these galaxies generally have weak CO emission. In this talk, I present the first detailed study of the dust and molecular gas content (as traced by CO) in the prototypical nearby blue compact dwarf galaxy II Zw 40. Using the extraordinary resolution and sensitivity of our ALMA Cycle 1 observations, we have separated the molecular gas emission into discrete GMC-sized clumps and measured their properties. The clouds within II Zw 40 have high linewidths for their size, reflecting the greater turbulence within II Zw40. However, despite their large linewidths, these clouds are largely still in virial equilibrium. Comparing the virial masses of the clouds to their CO luminosities, we find that the CO to molecular gas conversion factor within this galaxy is at least 5 times that of the Milky Way and possibly as high as 35 times. Even with the maximum CO-to-molecular gas conversion factor for this galaxy, we find that the star formation efficiency is still at least a factor of 3 higher than solar metallicity systems.\n",8,

The second sample is a subset of the optically selected sample containing 8070 galaxies with reliable S/N HI detections from ALFALFA. For the HI detected sample, SSFRs are similar regardless of large-scale environment. Investigating only the HI detected dwarf galaxies reveals a trend towards higher SSFRs in voids. Furthermore, we estimate the star formation rate per unit HI mass, known as the star formation efficiency (SFE) of a galaxy, as a function of environment. For the overall HI detected population, we notice no environmental dependence. Limiting the sample to dwarf galaxies again reveals a trend towards higher SFEs in voids.

Much of this tidal debris, known as the Magellanic System, is currently headed towards the disk of the Milky Way, spearheaded by the Leading Arm, with the Bridge connecting the two dwarf galaxies, and the trailing Magellanic Stream at the end. Estimates for the amount of gas that the Magellanic System contains are in the range of (2 − 4) × 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> and this could supply our Galaxy with (3.7 − 6.7) M<sub>⊙</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Fox et al. 2014). Although this is higher than the present star-formation rate of the Galaxy, the position of the tidal debris predisposes it to ionizing radiation from the extragalactic background and Galactic disk, as well as ram-pressure stripping from the halo, hindering gas accretion. Some parts of the Leading Arm, however, appear to have already survived the trip to the disk as their morphology is indicative of interaction with the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. The exact amount of gas that this structure contains is uncertain because of weak constrains in its distance. In this study, we made seven pointed Hα observations using the Wisconsin Hα Mapper Telescope and then compared the Hα intensity we obtained to models of the anticipated ionizing flux from the Milky Way and extragalactic background. From this, we calculated the distance from the Sun to the Leading Arm of the Magellanic System at the locations of our observations.\n",11,

The evolution of massive galaxies in close or compact groups is known to be characteristically different than in either pair-wise mergers or galaxy clusters. These environmental effects are likely to be even more significant in the shallow gravitational potential wells of dwarf galaxies. However, the role played by the close group environment in the evolution of dwarf galaxies is mostly uncharted territory. Determining the effects of interactions and mergers on the gas supplies, star formation, and subsequent enrichment of the ISM in low mass galaxies is a crucial step in understanding hierarchical assembly, as dwarf galaxies are expected to be the building blocks of more massive systems.\n",15,

Privon,Sessioned,University of Virginia; University of Arizona; Universidad de Concepción; Trent University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the TiNy Titans survey, the first systematic study of interactions between dwarf galaxies. Galaxy interactions are known to be of fundamental importance to the evolution of massive galaxies -- they have been observed to impact morphology, star formation rates, and ISM composition. Such interactions also occur frequently between low mass dwarf galaxies, but this process is poorly understood and largely overlooked in comparison. Although the majority of mergers at all redshifts are expected to take place between low mass galaxies, until now there have not been comparable systematic studies of dwarf galaxy interactions, leaving open the question of whether interactions between low mass galaxies can strongly affect their own evolution. The TiNy Titans survey, a complete sample of isolated dwarf galaxy pairs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), is specifically designed to address this gap in our understanding of galaxy evolution. The SEDs presented here, generated from archival WISE, SDSS, and GALEX photometric data, allow us to characterize the typical interacting dwarf galaxy, as well as quantify the deviations from this average distribution. We also present trends in the SEDs as a function of projected radial separation, a proxy for interaction stage.\n",16,

However, this model does not provide a satisfactory explanation for local, smaller scale features, such as the dynamics of dark matter dominated low surface brightness galaxies. Dubbed the core-cusp problem, the inner slope of these rotation curves is much lower than expected in pure ΛCDM simulations. High-resolution hydrodynamic simulations have attempted to alleviate this discrepancy by invoking baryonic feedback from supernovae driven gas outflows. These simulations can be tested by comparing to observed rotation curves directly. In applying this test, we take care to treat the simulations and the data in the same fashion, so that a direct comparison can be made.

In this study, we explore the impact of tidal disruption in the Hercules dwarf, a highly spatially extended ultra-faint dwarf which previous studies have suggested may have evidence of extra-tidal features. We performed time series imaging with the CTIO 4m/DECam to trace the extended structure of this galaxy with RR Lyrae stars.

We are undertaking a deep, wide-field imaging survey of nearby, isolated sub-Milky Way mass galaxies in order to (1) map the substructure, spatial extent, and metallicity of their stellar halos in resolved stars, and (2) search for faint dwarf satellite companions (i.e., the ``dwarfs of dwarfs""). These studies will allow us to explore the role of in-situ versus accretion processes in forming stellar halos in dwarfs, as well as constrain the faint end of the satellite galaxy luminosity function.

R. Weaver*,J. R. Weaver*; M. Gregg,Sessioned,"University of St Andrews; Maria Mitchell Observatory; UC, Davis","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): It is well established that galactic clusters provide dynamic environments in which to examine galaxy evolution. The starbursting dwarf irregular NGC 1427A presents an interesting case as it is being pulled into the nearby Fornax cluster at supersonic speeds, producing a visibly exceptional star formation rate and notably blue colors. It has been suggested that the highly deformed structure of NGC 1427A is due to ram pressure stripping as a result of interacting with a super-heated ICM provided by several nearby elliptical galaxies. The gas density profile of its leading edge is similar to a “bow-shock”, containing several dozen super-star clusters (SSCs) and thousands of smaller star forming clusters. It is clearly evident that the properties of NGC 1427A change rapidly over relatively short distances. Using dithered HST/ACS images in Sloan equivalent g' r' i' z' and Hα filters, we present a morphological and photometric study of NGC 1427A using a novel approach in which stellar properties are measured from sources grouped within localized regions. Apertures are fitted for ~5000 sources at 4σ using a filter-combined master image. Four characteristic regions are chosen to study stellar properties, selected interactively through DS9. We then introduce COMET, a specially-designed source catalog handler for producing graphical figures of each region, cropping both spatially and photometrically. These are then batch-reviewed and analyzed using synthetic isochrones corresponding of each region. Hα bright sources are indicated to illustrate the significance of SSCs. Secondary analysis is carried out using smoothed color maps of source-subtracted diffuse light, yielding penetrative mapping of underlying stellar populations. We show for the first time how the dynamical stellar populations of NGC 1427A differ as a function of position across the surface of the galaxy, ultimately furthering our understanding of cluster interactions and the evolution of irregular galaxies.

Carrillo*,A. Carrillo*; E. F. Bell; J. Bailin; A. Monachesi,Sessioned,University of Michigan; University of Alabama; Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context predict that galaxies should be surrounded by hundreds of relatively massive dark matter subhalos, each of which was expected to host a dwarf satellite galaxy. Large numbers of luminous dwarf galaxies do not exist around the Milky Way or M31 - this has been termed the missing satellite problem. There are a number of possible physical drivers of this discrepancy, some of which might predict significant differences from galaxy to galaxy. Accordingly, there are a number of efforts whose goal is to solidify and augment the census of dwarf satellites of external galaxies, outside the Local Group. Recently, Mueller, Jergen & Bingelli (2015; arXiv.1509.04931) presented 16 dwarf galaxy candidates in the vicinity of M83 using the Dark Energy CAMera (DECAM). With a field from the HST/GHOSTS survey that partly covers dw1335-29 (Radburn-Smith et al. 2011; ApJS, 195, 18) in conjunction with complementary ground-based images from VIMOS that cover the whole dwarf, we confirm that one of the candidates dw1335-29 is a dwarf satellite of M83, at a projected distance from M83 of 26 kpc and a with distance modulus of m-M<i> </i>= 28.5<sub>-0.1</sub><sup>+0.3</sup>, placing it in the M83 group. From our VIMOS imaging that covers the entire dwarf, we estimate an absolute magnitude of M<sub>V</sub> = -9.8<sub>-0.1</sub><sup>+0.3</sup>, show that it is elongated with an ellipticity of 0.35+/-0.15, and has a half light radius of 500+/-50pc. Dw1335-29 has both a somewhat irregular shape and has superimposed young stars in the resolved stellar population maps, leading us to classify this galaxy as a faint dwarf irregular or transition dwarf. This is especially curious, as with a projected distance of only 26kpc from M83, our prior expectation from study of the Local Group (following e.g., Grebel et al. 2003; AJ, 125, 1926, Slater & Bell 2013; ApJ, 772, 15) would be that dw1335-29 would lack recent star formation. Further study of M83's dwarf population will reveal if star formation in its dwarfs is commonplace (suggesting a lack of a hot gas envelope for M83 that would quench star formation) or rare (suggesting that dw1335-29 is at much larger 3D distance from M83, and is fortuitously projected to small radii).\n",25,

Donovan Meyer,Sessioned,University of Virginia; National Radio Astronomy Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs) have been long-classified as the red, ellipsoidal branch of the classic Hubble tuning fork diagram of galactic structure. In part with this classification, ETGs are thought to be molecular and atomic gas-poor with little to no recent star formation. However, recent efforts have questioned this ingrained classification. Most notably, the ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> survey of 260 ETGs within ~40 Mpc found 22% contain CO, a common tracer for molecular gas. The presence of cold molecular gas also implies the possibility for current star formation within these galaxies. Simulations do not accurately predict the recent observations and further studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms of ETGs.<br /><br />CO traces molecular gas starting at densities of ~10<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, which makes it a good tracer of bulk molecular gas, but does little to constrain the possible locations of star formation within the cores of dense molecular gas clouds. Formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO) traces molecular gas on the order of ~10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, providing a further constraint on the location of star-forming gas, while being simple enough to possibly be abundant in gas-poor ETGs. In cold molecular clouds at or above ~10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> densities, the structure of formaldehyde enables a phenomenon in which rotational transitions have excitation temperatures driven below the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), ~2.7 K. Because the CMB radiates isotropically, formaldehyde can be observed in absorption, independent of distance, as a tracer of moderately-dense molecular clouds and star formation.<br /><br />This novel observation technique of formaldehyde was incorporated for observations of twelve CO-detected ETGs from the ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> sample, including NGC 4710 and PGC 8815, to investigate the presence of cold molecular gas, and possible star formation, in ETGs. We present images from the Very Large Array, used in its C-array configuration, of the <i>J</i> = 1<sub>1,0</sub> – 1<sub>1,1</sub> transition of formaldehyde towards these sources.

The purpose of this poster is to test these predictions for the bar and spiral patterns of NGC 1365. The pattern speed is measured by fitting different forms of the Tremaine-Weinberg equations to H-alpha intensity and velocity maps. The results are the most consistent with the currently observed bar and spiral patterns being dynamically distinct features. They show compelling evidence for the bar rotating faster than the spiral pattern, inconsistent with a global wave mode or a manifold. The evidence for mode coupling of the bar and spiral patterns is weak due to inconsistencies in the results for different solution methods. The bar pattern speed is approximately constant between the inner Lindblad and corotation resonances, demonstrating that the solutions can detect large-scale, rigid patterns. Beyond the bar, the results resemble what is expected for coupled spiral modes and tidal interactions.\n",4,

As an example, we present a rotational velocity model fitted to an Hα velocity map of the spiral galaxy NGC 908, and find that the fitted systemic velocity gives good agreement with previous measurements in the literature.

This suggests the importance of the companion environment/morphology in determining the dust properties of a spiral galaxy in a close major-merger pair.\n",10,

The luminosity functions of these stars are compared with predicted distributions from simple star formation histories, and are best reproduced when the star formation rate has recently declined (past 10–50 Myr). In both interarm regions studied, significant amounts of FUV light remain after the detected stellar sources, clusters, and background galaxies are removed. The flux remaining is consistent with predictions of scattered light from radiative transfer models. In Pointing 1, which is immediately adjacent to a spiral arm, we find that scattered light from the arm must contribute significantly to the total FUV in that field (≈60%). Meanwhile, Pointing 2, which is further from any spiral arm or bright star-forming knots, has an upper bound of 16% scattered light. Thus the FUV emission in interarm regions in M101 is partly due to individual FUV-bright stars and partly due to light scattered from the spiral arms. The latter contribution is only significant immediately adjacent to spiral arms. <br />\n",12,

Chien,Sessioned,University of Iowa; Northern Arizona University; Lowell Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We investigate turbulent gas motions in spiral galaxies and their importance to star formation in far outer disks, where the column density is typically far below the critical value for spontaneous gravitational collapse. Following the methods of Burkhart et al. (2010) as applied to the Small Magellanic Cloud, we use the third and fourth statistical moments, skewness and kurtosis, which are indicators of structures caused by turbulence, to examine the integrated neutral hydrogen (Hι) column density of a sample of spiral galaxies selected from The Hι Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS, Walter et al. 2008). We examine the kurtosis and skewness values of each galaxy as a whole, as well as their variation as a function of radius and in discrete sub-regions defined by a square, moving 'kernel,' essentially splitting each galaxy into a grid. We then create individual grid maps of kurtosis and skewness for each galaxy. To investigate the relation between these moments and star formation, we compare these maps with maps of each galaxy's far-ultraviolet (FUV) image, taken by the <i>Galaxy Evolution Explorer </i>(GALEX) satellite. We find that the moments are largely uniform across the galaxies: the variation does not appear to trace any star forming regions. This may, however, be due to the spatial resolution of our analysis, which could potentially limit the scale of turbulent motions to at most ~700 pc. From our analysis of the comparison between the two moments themselves, we find that the gas motions in our sample galaxies are largely supersonic. This analysis shows that Burkhart et al. (2010)'s methods may be applied not just to dwarf galaxies but normal spiral galaxies as well.<br />We acknowledge the NSF for their funding of this work through their Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program (Grant No. AST-1461200).\n",13,

We devise multiple distance metrics to characterise the complex geometry of filaments, and find that galaxies closer to the orthogonal core of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near the periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. We also find that these peripheral galaxies have higher specific star formations at a given mass. Our results suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto filaments is primarily in an orthogonal direction. While the star formation rates of spiral galaxies in filaments are susceptible to their locations, we find that the global star formation rates of galaxies in different large scale environments are similar to each other. The primary discriminant in star formation rates is therefore the stellar mass of each spiral galaxy, as opposed to its large scale environment.\n",14,

Pueyo*,L. Pueyo*,Sessioned,Space Telescope Science Institute,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): A new class of high-contrast image analysis algorithms, that empirically fit and subtract systematic noise has lead to recent discoveries of faint exoplanet /substellar companions and scattered light images of circumstellar disks. The consensus emerging in the community is that these methods are extremely efficient at enhancing the detectability of faint astrophysical signal, but do generally create systematic biases in their observed properties. This poster provides a solution this outstanding problem. We present an analytical derivation of a linear expansion that captures the impact of astrophysical over/self-subtraction in current image analysis techniques. We examine the general case for which the reference images of the astrophysical scene moves azimuthally and/or radially across the field of view as a result of the observation strategy.  Our new method method is  based on perturbing the covariance matrix underlying any least-squares speckles problem and propagating this perturbation through the data analysis algorithm. This work is presented in the framework of Karhunen-Loeve Image Processing (KLIP) but it can be easily generalized to methods relying on linear combination of images (instead of eigen-modes). Based on this linear expansion, obtained in the most general case, we then demonstrate practical applications of this new algorithm. We first consider the case of the spectral extraction of faint point sources in IFS data  and illustrate, using public Gemini Planet Imager commissioning data, that our novel perturbation based Forward Modeling (which we named KLIP-FM) can indeed alleviate algorithmic biases. We then apply KLIP-FM to the detection of  point sources and show how it decreases the rate of false negatives while keeping the rate of false positives unchanged when compared to classical KLIP. This can potentially have important consequences on the design of  follow-up strategies of ongoing direct imaging surveys.\n",1,

Tsang*,D. Tsang*,Sessioned,University of Maryland,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Symplectic integrators are widely used for long-term integration of conservative astrophysical problems due to their ability to preserve the constants of motion; however, they cannot in general be applied in the presence of nonconservative interactions. In this Letter, we develop the “slimplectic” integrator, a new type of numerical integrator that shares many of the benefits of traditional symplectic integrators yet is applicable to general nonconservative systems. We utilize a fixed-time-step variational integrator formalism applied to the principle of stationary nonconservative action developed in Galley et al. As a result, the generalized momenta and energy (Noether current) evolutions are well-tracked. We discuss several example systems, including damped harmonic oscillators, Poynting–Robertson drag, and gravitational radiation reaction, by utilizing our new publicly available code to demonstrate the slimplectic integrator algorithm. Slimplectic integrators are well-suited for integrations of systems where nonconservative effects play an important role in the long-term dynamical evolution. As such they are particularly appropriate for cosmological or celestial N-body dynamics problems where nonconservative interactions, e.g., gas interactions or dissipative tides, can play an important role.\n",2,

Cochran,Sessioned,Wesleyan University; University of Arizona; University of Nebraska Kearney; University of Texas at Austin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Hot planets, i.e., those with orbital periods of a few days, can interact strongly with their host stars via gravitational tides, magnetic interactions, or via collisions between planetary and stellar winds or the planetary magnetosphere and the stellar wind. Recently, pre-transit absorption signals, caused by material orbiting ahead of the planet, have been detected around a handful of exoplanets. Two of these measurements, those for WASP-12 b (Llama et al. 2011) and HD 189733 b (Cauley et al. 2015), were interpreted as being the result of compressed material in a bow shock formed by the planetary magnetosphere plowing through the stellar wind. These signals are expected to be variable at some level as the planet passes through an inhomogenous stellar wind or corona and stellar activity levels change. To investigate this potential variability and confirm the detected signal, we have recently obtained followup observations to the 2013 transit reported in Cauley et al. (2015). The new measurements confirm the existence of the pre- and in-transit absorption detected in the 2013 data. However, the new signal is not consistent with the specific bow shock geometry presented in Cauley et al. (2015). We have performed a more detailed examination of the Ca II H and K line core flux, which is a proxy for the stellar activity level, for the 2013 data. We find a weak correlation between the Hα core flux and the Ca II core flux, suggesting that some, but not all, of the pre-transit absorption signature may be a result of changing stellar activity levels during the observations. Our examination of the Ca II core flux measurements uncover variability that is not seen using the S<sub>HK </sub>activity index. We are evaluating techniques to calibrate our Hα signal with these more detailed Ca II measurements and suggest that the core flux is a better proxy of low level stellar variability for a single epoch. In addition, the 2015 transit confirms that pre-transit absorption signals are variable and likely orbit through a highly dynamic environment that is dependent on the stellar activity level.

Ruffio,Sessioned,UC Berkeley; Space Telescope Science Institute; Stanford,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Direct imaging allows for the characterization of the orbits of exoplanets. However, to remove the glare of the host star, we must use observing strategies (e.g., angular differential imaging and spectral differential imaging) and data reduction techniques (e.g., Karhunen-Loève Image Projection; KLIP) that distort the apparent position of an exoplanet. Using recent methods to forward model the point spread function of a planet after using KLIP to subtract out the stellar light (Pueyo 2015), we are able to account for these astrometric biases. With the forward models, we can use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to derive the posterior distribution on the position of an exoplanet. To test our methodology, we apply our technique to Gemini Planet Imager integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data of the newly discovered exoplanet around 51 Eri and the extensively studied exoplanet beta Pictoris b. In general, this technique is applicable to any broadband direct imaging data and IFS data where the spectrum is assumed to be known.\n",5,

The transit depth of the light curve is used to infer the radius and, in combination with radial velocity measurements, the density of the planet, but the results can be biased if the light from the host star is the combined light of a pair of stars in a binary system or a chance alignment of two stars. Given the high frequency of binary star systems and the increasing number of transit exoplanet discoveries from Kepler, K2, and anticipated discoveries with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), this is a crucial point to consider when interpreting exoplanet properties. Companions were identified around five of the twelve targets at separations close enough that the brightness measurements of these host stars are in fact the combined brightness of two stars.

Generally, this is achieved by dividing the signal of the host star and planet from that of nearby field stars. For bright hot Jupiter exoplanets this procedure reveals the lightcurve. The lightcurve is then fit to a model of the planet’s orbit and the physical characteristics, also taking into account the characteristics of the star. The fit to the in-transit data coupled with the fit of the out-of-transit data establish the depth of the lightcurve.<br />The question then arises, what is the best way to select and treat the reference stars such that we can best characterize and remove the shared atmospheric systematics that plague our transit signal. To explore these questions we examine the effects of several assumptions that underline the calculation of the light curve depth. Our study involves photometric observations of hot Jupiter primary transits in the U and B filters taken with the University of Arizona’s Kuiper 1.55m telescope and Mont4K CCD. The data consists of repeated transit observations of a variety of exoplanets, each of which offers a unique field with stars of various brightness, spectral types, and angular distance from the host star. While these observations are part of a larger study of the Rayleigh scattering signature of hot Jupiter exoplanets, here we study the effects of various choices during the reduction phase, specifically the treatment of the reference stars and atmospheric systematics. Our study calculates the lightcurve for all permutations of the reference stars, considering several different out-of-transit assumptions (e.g. linear, quadratic or exponential). We assess the sensitivity of the transit depths based on the spread of the values and look for characteristics that minimize the scatter in the reduced lightcurve as well as analyze the effects of the treatment of individual variables on the resultant model.

Further study of lithium abundance in EHS is needed to better understand possible physical roles of lithium in planet formation theory. We use a large homogenous sample with accurate stellar parameters on which we will use equivalent width analysis to determine precise lithium abundances.

Ragozzine,Sessioned,Florida Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Many of the exoplanetary systems discovered by the Kepler space telescope demonstrate unusual properties which need to be explored in order to better understand planetary system formation and evolution. Among these interesting properties is an excess in the number of planets orbiting in resonance or near-resonance with their neighbors. The prevailing assumption in the planetary sciences community is that these are real features of the exoplanet population, but many theories developed on this assumption produce a resonance structure quite different from what we see. In our work we explore the possibility that the actual resonances may not be as we observe them, and may instead be explained by a combination of real resonance features and/or observational bias resulting from geometric effects. In particular, if the near-resonant systems have a different inclination distribution than other systems, then it is possible for them to be over or under-represented.<br /><br />We analyze the existing Kepler data and generate models which approximately represent the empirical period ratio distribution. The 2:1 and 3:2 just-wide-of-resonance excesses are included in the model, along with the deficit of period ratios just short of the 2:1 resonance. We test the Kepler data set against these models using the Python emcee package in order to determine the best-fit parameters for each model. We then address the inclination distribution question by generating two-planet systems with different inclination distributions for the near-resonant systems. We use the CORBITS package (https://github.com/jbrakensiek/CORBITS, Brakensiek & Ragozzine, submitted) to determine the probability of detecting both planets in transit. These tests adjust the relative sizes of the resonance excesses as well as orbital parameters (primarily inclination and nodal alignments) in order to determine which combinations of parameters would create in an observational bias resulting in the resonance excesses seen in the Kepler data.<br /><br />Initial results using first-approximation synthetic data show that some of the observed resonance excesses can be created in the observed data purely from geometric effects resulting from inclination varying as a function of period ratio.\n",12,

Stello,Sessioned,UNSW Australia; University of Sydney,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): One of the lessons learned from the Kepler prime mission is that our understanding of the detailed properties of transiting planets is fundamentally limited by our knowledge of the host star's properties. There is a critical need for self-consistent, spectroscopically-determined stellar parameters for the entire K2 sample. The innovative HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope offers a way forward, with the ability to obtain 400 spectra in a single pointing. HERMES operates at R=28,000 in four bandpasses specifically chosen to maximise the information on physical parameters such as chemical compositions, temperatures, and gravities. We describe an ongoing program to obtain spectra for as many K2 targets as possible down to V~14.75. The result will be a uniform catalog of stellar properties which will be invaluable for characterising the K2 exoplanet sample, and for informing studies of the population statistics (including non-planet hosts). Synergy with the K2 asteroseismology program will help to calibrate the evolutionary models used to determine stellar radii and masses, improving the accuracy and precision of the radii and masses of K2's planets, ultimately improving our understanding of the transition between Earth-like and Neptune-like worlds.\n",16,

By studying the orbital properties of a planet, like it's eccentricity and habitable zone inner edge distance we can answer this question. Here we answer the habitability question for the planets in the exoplanetary system K2-3 discovered by the Kepler 2 spacecraft. The system is compose of three planets with radii 1.61-2.17 R<sub>earth,</sub> and with orbital periods of 10-45 days. The most outer planet in this system known as K2-3d is particularly interesting due to its proximity towards the habitable zone. The eccentricities of the planets in K2-3 were calculated using a method known as stellar density profiling, and from these eccentricities the range of the semi-major axis were determined. The planet K2-3d was calculated to have a semi-major axis of 0.18 AU, which puts it outside the habitable zone where inner edge of the habitable zone is 0.27 AU from its host star. This project was supported by the The Harvard Banneker Institute.\n",17,

Equilibrium temperature is often determined assuming a circular orbit and, therefore, a constant star-planet separation, especially for low-mass transiting exoplanets. Using photometric data from the first Kepler mission, we analyze the transit light curves of Kepler 186, an exoplanetary system located approximately 150pc from Earth. In this poster, we report new lower limits on the eccentricities of the system found using the astrodensity profiling method and discuss how those values effect habitabilty. We also report other orbital, stellar, and planetary properties, which are consistent with, though slightly more precise than, the values reported in Quintana et al, 2014. We assert that, with an eccentricity of 0.092, a semimajor axis of 0.35 AU, and a radius of 1.06 Earth radii, Kepler 186f is an Earth-sized exoplanet that spends its entire orbit in the habitable zone of its star.\n",18,

P. Thomas*,B. P. Thomas*; J. L. Birkby,Sessioned,Howard University; Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; NASA Sagan Fellow,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Transit light curves contain a wealth of information about the basic properties of a planet, such as its radius, semi-major axis, and orbital period. For the latter property, there is a distinct lack of planets with periods between 10 to 100 days. This gap could be caused by something as simple as observational bias, or as prominent as planetary formation or migration. Here, we report an investigation into the atmosphere of planets within this orbital period valley, to search for differences that may indicate a different formation mechanism or migration path to those outside of it. We do this by searching for the secondary eclipse of planets in the valley in order to measure their albedos. We determined an optimal target for this: KOI-366 b (P ~ 75 days). However, we find that despite the exquisite precision of Kepler data, it cannot constrain the albedo for this long-orbit planet candidate. We measure a 1σ upper limit on the geometric albedo of Ag,1σ ≤ 2.0. We highlight that additional scatter in the light curve is likely caused by a ~ 2-day pulsation of the giant host star, and that further data is required to measure the secondary eclipse. KOI-366 is one of the best suited of all host stars with long period exoplanet candidates for follow-up due to its relatively bright magnitude (Kp = 11.7 mag), but the full investigation of the reflective properties of long period planets may require space-based observations from future instruments, such as WFIRST, that will be more sensitive to objects further away from their host stars.

We then compare these $rho_R$ values with the planetary densities previously measured via a combination of transit, TTV, and radial velocity measurements. We identify several planet candidates for which $\rho_R$ is within the observed range of planetary densities. Detailed study of mass loss via Roche-lobe overflow is potentially interesting for these systems.\n",20,

Johnson,Sessioned,Princeton University; Harvard University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): While the vast majority of multiple-planet systems have their orbital angular momentum axes aligned with the spin axis of their host star, Kepler-56 is an exception: its two transiting planets are coplanar yet misaligned by 40 degrees with respect to their host star. Additional follow-up observations of Kepler-56 suggest the presence of a massive, non-transiting companion that may help explain this misalignment. We model the transit data along with Keck/HIRES and HARPS radial velocity data to update the orbital parameters of the two transiting planets and infer the physical properties of the third, nontransiting planet. We employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to calculate the best-fitting orbital parameters and the uncertainties, calculating posterior distributions on the physical parameters of each planet.<br /><br />We find a maximally likely scenario in which the additional RV signal beyond the two transiting planets come from only one planet with a period of 1000 days and minimum mass of 6 Jupiter masses. Given this minimum mass, the perturber could be a giant planet or brown dwarf, either of which would have implications on the formation of the Kepler-56 system. To further refine the allowed parameters of Kepler-56d, we use REBOUND to test the gravitational stability of simulated Kepler-56 systems to determine which of our RV-allowed systems are dynamically stable over the lifetime of this planetary system.\n",21,

Its high signal-to-noise, moderate spectral resolution, and broad wavelength range spectra will provide an unprecedented look into the atmospheres of large to small and hot to temperate planets. In this contribution we explore the degree to which JWST spectra will be able to realistically constrain bulk atmospheric properties including molecular volume mixing ratios and thermal structures. We start by modeling the atmospheres of archetypal hot Jupiter, warm Neptune, warm sub-Neptune, and cool super-Earth planets with clear, cloudy, or high mean molecular weight variations. Next we simulate the λ = 1 − 11 μm transmission and emission spectra of these systems for several JWST instrument modes with realistic signal and noise components. We then perform atmospheric retrievals to determine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, NH3) can be constrained. Using these results, we assess what instrument modes will be most useful for determining these values, and then we infer the metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen ratios for the chosen planet archetypes. We also examine how well the expected constraints on the molecular abundances and temperatures enable the exploration of disequilibrium chemistry and planet formation. We will not know the exact noise properties of JWST data until after its launch, but we expect that these results will provide realistic predictions of the scientific value of single event (transit or secondary eclipse) spectra.\n",22,

The collision-induced absorption (CIA) of hydrogen with carbon dioxide or nitrogen has been shown to have a substantial effect on the atmospheric temperature and albedo of a planet, possibly to the point at which life could exist on a planet where without such CIA the planet would be too cold. Using a single-column radiative-convective climate model, we investigated the effect of the presence of hydrogen on planetary temperatures and albedos across different amounts of hydrogen and across host stars of different temperatures using present-day Mars-like planets. We found that the addition of hydrogen in a planet's atmosphere increased the surface temperature of the planet. This effect was stronger for the planets orbiting hotter stars. The water vapor profiles showed that this was the case due to the presence of more water vapor in the atmospheres of planets orbiting hotter stars across all percentages of hydrogen. The water vapor concentrations also varied more with the addition of more hydrogen for the planets orbiting hotter stars.\n",23,

Due to Kepler’s high precision photometry, we can study the reflected light from a planet, the ellipsoidal variations of a star, and the small Doppler beaming signal due to the gravitational interaction between a planet and host star. To predict how the beaming signal varies as a function of stellar system parameters, we numerically simulate the beaming signals both Kepler and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) would detect. We predict what mass planets TESS will be capable of detecting given the solar neighborhood population of stars and known population of exoplanets. Doppler beaming is largest for massive, short-period planets around cool stars and is more easily detectable by Kepler than TESS. Kepler’s advantage is its bluer bandpass, longer time baseline, and higher precision.\n",24,

Fifty model exoplanet spectra that span temperatures from 400 to 2000 K, gravities from 100 to 1000 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and are 0.3-3 times solar metallicity composition are obtained by converting the pressure-temperature profiles through publicly available radiative transfer code (DISORT), assuming chemical equilibrium conditions. We explore the dependency of an individual specie's effect on a spectrum in the near-IR by removing its equilibrium abundance or enriching the specie's abundance. While testing for the individual effect of each species, it is found that the temperature is a key property for identifying absorption features in this diverse set of model spectra. Strong and abundant absorbers such as CO and CH<sub>4</sub> are not as prevalent in high temperature models over 1200 K as H<sub>2</sub>O at 0.9-2.2 and 2.3-4.1 microns. In addition, we investigate the vertical mixing and disequilibrium of CO and CH<sub>4</sub> and find features of these carbon species at 3.3-4.2 and 4.3-5.0 microns across all models. Trace species such as NH<sub>3</sub> and Na exhibit prevalent signatures in cold planets (~400-800 K) at the 1-1.1, 1.3-1.5, and 1.6-1.8 micron ranges. A consistent PH<sub>3</sub> feature is identified for 400 K spectra at 4-4.8 microns. In our hot model spectra with temperatures greater than 1400 K, TiO shows more significant absorption features than VO, suggesting that these molecules potentially play separate roles in determining thermal inversions.

Rasio,Sessioned,"Northwestern University; University of Nevada, Las Vegas","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The orbital spacing, Δ, between two planets in units of their mutual Hill radii gives insight into their dynamical stability. A well-defined power law relationship derived through numerical simulations gives the average time to instability for systems with equally spaced planets of a certain Δ. Previous work has established the change in the relationship between Δ and instability time for various planet masses and planet multiplicity, however, less work has been done to understand the distribution of instability times for an ensemble of systems with fixed initial Δ. We use Mercury6 to simulate thousands of planetary systems that all have equally spaced planets. We find that the distribution of instability time, measured in time from initial condition until a close-encounter of less than one Hill radius, for four, near-circular and coplanar bodies of a given initial Δ is log-normal and spreads over more than an order of magnitude. New insight into planetary system instability is found when we compare the time until a close-encounter of a pair of planets in a system to the time until a planetary collision in the same system. Collisions are the most common manifestation of instability in these simulations. A large fraction of simulated systems do not have collisions on the same time scale as their close-encounters. This fraction of systems form an approximately log-uniform ‘tail’ to the distribution of instability times that expands many orders of magnitude past the log-normal distribution. The fraction of systems in the tail is dependent on the innermost planet’s semi-major axis, while the distribution of close-encounter times is scale-invariant. With these findings we aim to give insight into tightly-packed exoplanetary systems and post-gas disk formation of planetary systems where these dynamics that depend on orbital spacing are essential.\n",28,

It is challenging to compare science simulation results and systematically test the effects of changing instrument or mission designs.

EXOSIMS consists of stand-alone modules written in Python which may be individually modified without requiring modifications to the code elsewhere. This structure allows for user driven systemic exploration of the effects of changing designs on the estimated science yield.<br />The modules of EXOSIMS are classified as either input or simulation modules. Input modules contain specific mission design parameters and functions. These include Planet Population, Star Catalog, Optical System, Zodiacal Light, Planet Physical Model, Observatory, Time Keeping, and Post-Processing. Simulation modules perform tasks requiring input from one or more input modules as well as calling functions from other simulation modules. These include Completeness, Target List, Simulated Universe, Survey Simulation, and Survey Ensemble. The required parameters and functionality of each of these modules is defined in the documentation for EXOSIMS.<br />EXOSIMS is available to the public at https://github.com/dsavransky/EXOSIMS.

Future development of EXOSIMS is intended to be community-driven. Mission planners and instrument designers may quickly write their own modules, following the guidelines in the interface control document, and drop them directly into the code without making additional modifications elsewhere. It is expected that EXOSIMS will be highly useful for designing and planning future exoplanet direct imaging missions.\n",2,

Fleming,Sessioned,Wesleyan University; STScI,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Kepler mission has revolutionized the study of exoplanets by dramatically increasing the available sample size. However, the catalog of planet candidates created by the mission team is constrained to stars that exhibit at least three transit-like events. Cloud-Kepler is an open-source software package designed to search archived Kepler data for planets that may have been missed by looking for either aperiodic or single- and double-transit events. It uses a variant of the Box-Least Squares (BLS) algorithm that we call “BLS-pulse” which identifies the single best-fitting transit-like event in a given segment of a light curve. While testing the program on a random sample of Kepler Objects of Interests (KOIs), we found a single transit-like event (probably a stellar eclipse) of KIC 1717717 centered at MJD = 56271.70. Using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we compared viable star-planet and star-star solutions to constrain physical parameters based on the available observables (e.g., depth, duration, host star colors, coverage of the photometry). We present our analysis on the KIC 1717717 system, along with plans to further adapt this MCMC method to use with missions like K2 and TESS that have even shorter observing baselines, and will therefore expect to find many more such single- and double-transit events.\n",5,

The mass of Kepler-78b has been measured using the radial velocity technique, but this measurement is complicated by significant stellar activity, especially starspots. We present a new method for modeling starspots by applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo process to the SOAP 2.0 starspot model. We apply this method to all available data simultaneously, including measurements of radial velocity, bisector span, and full width at half maximum. We recover the mass of Kepler-78b with excellent agreement to previous mass estimates. We also characterize the starspots of Kepler-78, constraining the latitude, longitude, size, and temperature of each spot group, and finding evidence of starspot evolution. Importantly, using both radial velocity measurements and line shape diagnostics seems to break the degeneracy between spot size and spot temperature. If this is correct, we also find that the starspots are warmer than one would expect of a G-type star. Our method of modeling starspots will allow us to better understand the surface phenomena of stars, as well as the properties of their planetary systems.\n",9,

Blake*,A. Blake*; A. Roberge,Sessioned,Howard University; NASA GSFC,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The goal of this project is to further our growing knowledge of exoplanets in the solar neighborhood. The nearby star Beta Pictoris, which is nearly twice the mass of the Sun, is encircled by a huge disk of dust and gas reaching out 500-800 AU from the star. This so-called “debris disk” is the product of collisions between large numbers of asteroids and comets orbiting this relatively young star. The presence of these small planetary bodies hinted that there might be planets in the disk as well, which was recently confirmed when a ground-based telescope directly imaged a super-Jupiter exoplanet orbiting the star.<br /><br />The debris disk of Beta Pic tells us that this planetary system is edge-on from our vantage point on Earth. Therefore, it is an ideal system to use transit photometry to search for additional planets. We hope to due so by monitoring the brightness of the star over a given period, using a telescope on small satellite (a CubeSat). A CubeSat is a very small satellite tasked with a single purpose and, in this case, a single target. The advantage of a CubeSat over a larger telescope is the low cost and fast development schedule. Since we wish to study only one star’s system, a CubeSat is an economical choice, although the limited lifetime of a CubeSat means that only planets with relatively short (up to few month) periods may be found. Our preliminary calculations show that, in principle, we can discover planets from Jupiter-size down to Neptune-size around Beta Pic with a telescope sized to fit in a CubeSat.\n",10,

Five of the 12 sites are currently installed, with full operational capability expected by the end of 2016. Though optimized for studying near-earth objects to accomplish its primary mission of Space Situational Awareness (SSA), the Falcon telescopes are in many ways similar to those used by ongoing and planned exoplanet transit surveys targeting individual M dwarf stars (e.g., MEarth, APACHE, SPECULOOS). The network’s worldwide geographic distribution provides additional potential advantages. We have performed analytical and empirical studies exploring the viability of employing the FTN for a future survey of nearby late-type M dwarfs tailored to detect transits of 1-2R<sub>Earth</sub> exoplanets in habitable-zone orbits . We present empirical results on photometric precision derived from data collected with multiple Falcon telescopes on a set of nearby (< 25 pc) M dwarfs using  infrared filters and a range of exposure times, as well as sample light curves created from images gathered during known transits of varying transit depths. An investigation of survey design parameters is also described, including an analysis of site-specific weather data, anticipated telescope time allocation and the percentage of nearby M dwarfs with sufficient check stars within the Falcons' 11' x 11' field-of-view required to perform effective differential photometry.  The results of this ongoing effort will inform the likelihood of discovering one (or more) habitable-zone exoplanets given current occurrence rate estimates over a nominal five-year campaign, and will dictate specific survey design features in preparation for initiating project execution when the FTN begins full-scale automated operations.\n",13,

For most exoplanets with a radius about the size of Earth, evaluating their physical properties, such as the mass, radius and equilibrium temperature, cannot be determined with satisfactory precision. The MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) was recently built to obtain spectroscopic and photometric measurements to find, confirm, and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. MINERVA’s spectroscopic survey targets the brightest, nearby stars which are well-suited to the array’s capabilities, while its primary photometric goal is to search for transits around these bright targets. Typically, it is difficult to find satisfactory comparison stars within a telescope’s field of view when the primary target is very bright. This issue is resolved by using one of MINERVA’s telescopes to observe the primary bright star while the other telescopes observe a distinct field of view that contains satisfactory bright comparison stars. We describe the code used to identify nearby comparison stars, schedule the four telescopes, produce differential photometry from multiple telescopes, and show the first results from this effort.<br /><br />This work has been funded by the Ronald E.

Sithajan*,S. Sithajan*; J. Ge; J. Wang,Sessioned,University of Florida; California Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The red and NIR region, where K and M dwarfs emit most of light, is the desirable region for radial velocity (RV) measurements for detecting low mass planets, but this wavelength region is heavily contaminated with telluric absorption lines. Variation in the telluric line depths and centroids can result in large RV measurement uncertainties, limiting the sensitivity to detect low mass planets. Here we use simulations to study effect of telluric removal and the residuals on RV measurements and determine the level of correction needed to minimize the effect. Simulated spectra from three representative spectrographs with spectral resolutions, R=60K, 80K, 100K and 120K for wavelength coverage at 0.38-0.62 μm (called the optical spectrograph), 0.38-0.90 μm (called the broad optical spectrograph) and 0.90-2.4 μm (called the NIR spectrograph), have been studied. Two methods are used to study the RV effect by the telluric lines. The first one is a ‘Masking’ method, in which the telluric lines are identified and removed from RV calculation. The other method is a ‘Removal’ method, in which all heavily saturated lines are masked out and the remaining lines are subtracted by synthetic atmospheric spectra to a desired level. Our results show that, in case of late M dwarfs, the broad optical spectrograph can gain additional RV sensitivity over the optical spectrograph if telluric lines can be modeled and subtracted to better than 10%, or all lines deeper than 5% are masked out from RV calculation. For the earlier type stars, it requires better than 2% modeling and subtracting precision with the broad optical spectrograph to gain additional Doppler sensitivity over the optical spectrograph. Besides the photon gain with the NIR spectrograph over the optical spectrograph for late M dwarf observations, the NIR can gain additional advantage of Doppler sensitivity over the optical tool for late M dwarfs when telluric residuals can be subtracted to below 1%. However, it is never better than the broad optical spectrograph in any cases with the same residual levels. These indicate the broad optical spectrograph can potentially be an optimal spectrograph for high precision RV surveys for low mass planets.\n",19,

Belikov,Sessioned,NASA ARC,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Many concepts have been proposed to enable direct imaging of planets around nearby stars, and which would enable spectroscopic observations of their atmospheric observations and the potential discovery of biomarkers. The main technical challenge associated with direct imaging of exoplanets is to effectively control both the diffraction and scattered light from the star so that the dim planetary companion can be seen. Usage of an internal coronagraph with an adaptive optical system for wavefront correction is one of the most mature methods and is being developed as an instrument addition to the WFIRST-AFTA space mission. In addition, such instruments as GPI and SPHERE are already being used on the ground and are yielding spectra of giant planets. For the deformable mirror (DM) to recover a dark hole region with sufficiently high contrast in the image plane, mid-spatial frequency wavefront errors must be estimated. To date, most broadband lab demonstrations use narrowband filters to obtain an estimate of the the chromaticity of the wavefront error and this can result in usage of a large percentage of the total integration time. Previously, we have proposed a method to estimate the chromaticity of wavefront errors using only broadband images; we have demonstrated that under idealized conditions wavefront errors can be estimated from images composed of discrete wavelengths. This is achieved by using DM probes with sufficient spatially-localized chromatic diversity. Here we report on the results of a study of the performance of this method with respect to realistic broadband images including noise. Additionally, we study optimal probe patterns that enable reduction of the number of probes used and compare the integration time with narrowband and IFS estimation methods.\n",21,

We present a computationally efficient Monte Carlo method that fits randomly generated orbital parameters to astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets from a fraction of an orbit. This code quickly and efficiently produces distributions of plausible orbital parameters, while a traditional Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm would take much longer to converge given the same inputs (future work will directly compare the computational efficiencies and outputs of both algorithms).This technique allows us to predict the future motion of a planet by randomly generating plausible orbits that fit just a few epochs of astrometry, or even a single epoch. We first applied this method to predicting the future position of 51 Eri b, a giant exoplanet discovered by GPIES, using astrometry with only a 1-month baseline. Subsequent observations of 51 Eri b after seven months found the planet at the peak of the probability distributions predicting future motion.

While in principle the level of contrast required for direct imaging of exoplanets can be achieved by stellar coronagraphic imaging, the resulting dark hole is highly sensitive to phase aberrations. In order to effectively suppress starlight for exoplanet imaging applications, low-order wavefront aberrations entering a coronagraph such as tip-tilt, defocus and coma must be determined and compensated for. A sparse-aperture mask (SAM) can be integrated in the telescopic imaging system to make precise estimate of low-order wavefront aberrations. In this technique, the starlight rejected by the coronagraph's focal plane stop is collimated to a relay pupil, where the mask forms an interference fringe pattern on a detector and the phase aberrations are inferred from this fringe pattern. At Princeton’s High Contrast Imaging Lab (HCIL), we have numerically proved this concept and we are currently working on verifying it experimentally.\n",25,

Vanderbei,Sessioned,Princeton University; NASA Ames,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): An external occulter is a spacecraft flown along the line-of-sight of a space telescope to suppress starlight and enable high-contrast direct imaging of exoplanets. Laboratory verification of occulter designs is necessary to validate the optical models used to design and predict occulter performance. At Princeton, we have designed and built a testbed that allows verification of scaled occulter designs whose suppressed shadow is mathematically identical to that of space occulters. The occulter testbed uses 78 m optical propagation distance to realize the flight Fresnel numbers. We will use an etched silicon mask as the occulter. The occulter is illuminated by a diverging laser beam to reduce the aberrations from the optics before the occulter. Here, we present first light result of a sample design operating at a flight Fresnel number and the mechanical design of the testbed. We compare the experimental results with simulations that predict the ultimate contrast performance.\n",26,

Tests of this approach have been and continue to be conducted in the lab and in the field (Samuele et al., 2010, Glassman et al., 2014) using non-collimated light sources with a spherical wavefront.  We extend the current approach to performing night-time observations of astronomical objects using small-scale (approximately 1/300th) starshades and the McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory.  We placed a starshade directly in the path of the beam from an astronomical object in front of the main heliostat. Using only flat mirrors, we then directed the light through the observatory path and reflected it off the West heliostat to an external telescope located approximately 270m away, for an effective baseline of 420m.<br />This configuration allowed us to make measurements of flat wavefront sources with a Fresnel number close to those expected in proposed full-scale space configurations.

In an effort to validate the starlight-suppression performance of the Starshade, we have measured contrast better than 1X10<sup>-9</sup> using 60 cm Starshades at points just beyond the Starshade tips. These measurements were made over a 50% spectral bandpass, using an incoherent light source (a white LED), and in challenging outdoor test environments. Our experimental setup is designed to provide Starshade to telescope separation and telescope aperture size that are scaled as closely as possible to the flight system. The measurements confirm not only the overall starlight-suppression capability of the Starshade concept but also the robustness of the setup to optical disturbances such as atmospheric effects at the test site. The spectral coverage is limited only by the optics and detectors in our test setup, not by the Starshade itself. Here we describe our latest results as well as detailed comparisons of the measured results to model predictions. Plans and status of the next phase of ground testing are also discussed.\n",28,

Most of these represented companies directly involved in its construction, notably Corning Glass Works, which was justly proud of its magnificent accomplishment. But companies only vaguely linked to the project, or not at all, also co-opted the mystique of “the World’s Largest Eye” to promote their goods or services.

The telescope will be launched aboard a high-altitude balloon in December 2016 for a 4-week flight from McMurdo station in Antarctica. BLAST-TNG will measure the polarization of submillimeter thermal emission from magnetically aligned interstellar dust grains, using large format arrays of kinetic inductance detectors operating in three bands centered at 250, 350, and 500 microns, with sub-arcminute angular resolution. The optical system includes an achromatic Half Wave Plate (HWP), mounted in a Half Wave Plate rotator (HWPr). The HWP and HWPr will operate at 4 K temperature to reduce thermal noise in our measurements, so it was crucial to account for the effects of thermal contraction at low temperature in the HWPr design. It was also equally important for the design to meet torque requirements while minimizing the power from friction and conduction dissipated at the 4 K stage. We also discuss our plan for cold testing the HWPr using a repurposed cryostat with a Silicon Diode thermometer read out by an EDAS-CE Ethernet data acquisition system.\n",2,

Fich*,M. Fich*,Sessioned,Univ. of Waterloo,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Over cosmic time, half of the radiation emitted by stars has been absorbed by dust and subsequently re-emitted at rest-frame far-infrared to submillimeter wavelengths. A full understanding of the star formation history of the Universe thus requires observations in the submillimeter wavebands. We here give a status update on CCAT, which is envisioned to be a 25-m class submillimeter telescope that will enable a broad range of astronomical studies focused on the origins of stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters. Some of the primary science goals enabled by CCAT will be (1) a detailed measurement of the dust-obscured fraction of the cosmic star formation history back to within the first billion years of cosmic time - by resolving, for the first time, almost the entire far-infrared background light into individual sources, (2) a characterization of the physical mechanisms and energy sources that power the emission from the galaxies involved - such as stellar radiation, shocks, or active galactic nuclei - through spectroscopy, (3) tracing the cycles and components of star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies over large scales at unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution, and in a wide range of different environments, and (4) probing the astrophysical processes in galaxy clusters through multi-band, high resolution studies of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Located on a high elevation site in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile (at 5600 meter altitude), CCAT is designed to provide sensitive high angular resolution observations at submillimeter wavelengths (3.5"" at 350 micron) over up to a 1 square degree field-of-view. The combination of a large aperture telescope with a precise surface (<17 micron rms wave front error) at a prime observing site, a wide field-of-view (and hence, high mapping speed) utilized through state-of-the-art, large-format cameras and sensitive, multi-object spectrometers makes CCAT an exceptionally powerful discovery instrument.\n",3,

We reduced data from the Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) instrument on the Magellan Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory. FIRE is a medium-resolution echelle spectrometer, whose data reduction results in a spectrum of a star. When reducing FIRE data, it is important to account for inconsistencies in the data, such as bad pixels, cosmic rays, and the effects of our atmosphere. Using the FIREhose pipeline, these inconsistencies can be accounted for and corrected using a A0 telluric with a known spectrum. After telluric correcting, the data reduction results in a primed spectrum for an object, which can then be used to determine an object’s physical properties, such as atmospheric composition, radial velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity.\n",5,

CHARIS will take spectra of brown dwarfs and hot Jovian planets in the coronagraphic image provided by the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) and AO188 adaptive optics systems. The system is designed to detect objects five orders of magnitude dimmer than their parent star down to an 80 milliarcsecond inner working angle. For characterization, CHARIS has a ‘high-resolution’ prism providing an average spectral resolution of R82, R69, and R82 in J, H, and K bands respectively. The so-called discovery mode uses a second ‘low-resolution’ prism with an average spectral resolution of R19 spanning 1.15-2.37 microns (J+H+K bands).  This is unique compared to other high contrast IFS designs. It augments low inner working angle performance by reducing the separation at which we can rely on spectral differential imaging. The principal challenge for a high-contrast IFS is quasi-static speckles, which cause undue levels of spectral crosstalk. CHARIS has addressed this through several key design aspects that should constrain crosstalk between adjacent spectral features to be below 1%. Sitting on the Nasmyth platform, the alignment between the lenslet array, prism, and detector will be highly stable, key for the performance of the data pipeline. Nearly every component has arrived and the project is entering its final build phase. Here we review the science case, the resulting design, status of final construction, and lessons learned that are directly applicable to future exoplanet instruments.\n",7,

In November 2007 a Workshop on a National Plan for Preserving Astronomical Photographic Data (<i>2009ASPC,410,33O, Osborn, W. & Robbins, L</i>) was held at PARI. The result was the establishment of the Astronomical Photographic Data Archive (APDA) at PARI. In late 2013 PARI began ALP (Astronomy Legacy Project). ALP's purpose is to digitize an extensive set of twentieth century photographic astronomical data housed in APDA. Because of the wide range of types of plates, plate dimensions and emulsions found among the 40+ collections, plate digitization will require a versatile set of scanners and digitizing instruments. Internet crowdfunding was used to assist in the purchase of additional digitization equipment that were described at AstroPlate2014 Plate Preservation Workshop (www.astroplate.cz) held in Prague, CZ, March, 2014. Equipment purchased included an Epson Expression 11000XL scanner and two Nikon D800E cameras. These digital instruments will compliment a STScI GAMMA scanner now located in APDA. GAMMA will be adapted to use an electroluminescence light source and a digital camera with a telecentric lens to achieve high-speed high-resolution scanning. The 1μm precision XY stage of GAMMA will allow very precise positioning of the plate stage. Multiple overlapping CCD images of small sections of each plate, tiles, will be combined using a photo-mosaic process similar to one used in Harvard's DASCH project. Implementation of a software pipeline for the creation of a SQL database containing plate images and metadata will be based upon APPLAUSE as described by Tuvikene at AstroPlate2014 (www.astroplate.cz/programs/).\n",17,

Jeram*,S. Jeram*; J. Ge; P. Jiang; B. Phillips,Sessioned,University of Florida,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Silicon moth-eye antireflective structures have emerged to be an excellent approachfor reducing the amount of light that is lost upon incidence on a given surface of optics made of silicon. This property has been exploited for a wide variety of products ranging from eyeglasses and flat-panel displays to solar panels. These materials typically come in the form of coatings that are applied to an optical substrate such as glass. Moth-eye coatings, made of a periodic array of subwavelength pillars on silicon substrates or other substrates, can produce the desired antireflection (AR) performance for a broad wavelength range and over a wide range of incident angles. In the field of astronomy, every photon striking a detector is significant – and thus, losses from reflectivity at the various optical interfaces before a detector can have significant implications to the science at hand. Moth-eye AR coatings on these optical interfaces may minimize their reflection losses while maximizing light throughput for a multitude of different astronomical instruments. In addition, moth-eye AR coatings, which are patterned directly on silicon surfaces, can significantly enhance the coating durability. At the University of Florida, we tested two moth-eye filters designed for use in the near-infrared regime at 1-8 microns by examining their optical properties, such as transmission, the scattered light, and wavefront quality, and testing the coatings at cryogenic temperatures to characterize their viability for use in both ground- and space-based infrared instruments.

Examples include H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>3</sub>OH, among others. There is growing evidence that in some environments, such as within the cores of dense molecular clouds and the mid-plane of protoplanetary disks, the amounts of these species in ices far exceeds that in the gas phase. As a result, collisions between ice-bearing bodies and newly forming planets are thought to be a major means of delivering these key species to young planets. There currently exist fewer than 250 ice absorption spectra toward Galactic molecular clouds, which is insufficient to reliably trace the ice content of clouds through the various stages of collapse to star and planet formation, or assess the effects of their environments and physical conditions, such as cloud density, internal temperature, presence or absence of embedded sources, external UV and X-ray radiation, gas-phase composition, or cosmic-ray ionization rate, on the ice composition for clouds at similar evolutionary stages. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these findings connect to our own Solar System.<br />SPHEREx, which is a mission in NASA's Small Explorer (SMEX) program that was selected for a Phase A study in July 2015, will be a game changer for the study of interstellar, circumstellar, and protoplanetary disk ices.

SPHEREx will detect millions of potential background continuum point sources already catalogued by NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at 3.4 and 4.6 microns for which there is evidence for intervening gas and dust based on the 2MASS+WISE colors with sufficient sensitivity to yield ice absorption spectra with SNR ≥ 100 per spectral resolution element. The resulting > 100-fold increase in the number of high-quality ice absorption spectra toward a wide variety of regions distributed throughout the Galaxy will reveal correlations between ice content and environment not possible with current spectra.

The EBL can be constrained both through direct photometric measurements and through measurements of anisotropies in the EBL which take advantage of the fact that extragalactic populations produce fluctuations with distinct spatial and spectral characteristics from local foregrounds.  Because the amplitude of the linear clustering signal is proportional to the total photon emission, large-scale EBL anisotropies are an important tracer of star formation history.  In particular, EBL anisotropies trace the underlying clustering of faint emission sources, such as low mass objects present during the EOR, dwarf galaxies, and intra-halo light (IHL), all of which are components not readily detected in point source surveys. The fluctuation amplitude measured independently by a number of recent experiments exceeds that expected from the large-scale clustering of known galaxy populations, indicating the presence of a large integrated brightness from these faint and diffuse components.  <br /><br />SPHEREx, a mission in NASA's Small Explorer (SMEX) program that was selected for Phase A in July 2015, is an all-sky survey satellite designed to address all three science goals in NASA’s astrophysics division: to probe the origin and destiny of our Universe; to explore whether planets around other stars could harbor life; and to explore the origin and evolution of galaxies.

These include spatially resolved spectroscopy in the UV and optical, high spatial resolution echelle spectroscopy in the UV, and solar-blind imaging in the UV. In addition, STIS possesses unique visible-light coronagraphic modes that keep the instrument at the forefront of exoplanet and debris-disk research. As the instrument's characteristics evolve over the instrument’s lifetime, the instrument team at Space Telescope Science Institute monitors its performance and works towards improving the quality of its products. Here we present updates on the status of the STIS CCD and FUV & NUV MAMA detectors, as well as changes to the CalSTIS reduction pipeline and available instrument modes.

Debes,Sessioned,STScI,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) team at STScI has created stand-alone automated software to apply Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) corrections to STIS CCD data. CTI results from radiation damage to the CCD detector during its many years in the space environment on-board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The software will remove trails and other image artifacts caused by CTI, and will help correct target fluxes and positions to their proper values. The software script (stis_cti v1.0) uses a pixel-based correction algorithm, and will correct both images and spectra. It automatically generates CTI corrected dark reference files, applies CTI corrections to the science data, and outputs the usual CALSTIS products with CTI corrections applied. Currently only the most common observation modes are supported -- full-frame, non-binned data, taken with the default CCD amplifier; future enhancements may include sub-array data.

H. Brooks*,B. H. Brooks*,Sessioned,Space Telescope Science Institute,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the primary imager of JWST with observing wavelengths covering 0.6 to 5.0 μm. A dichroic beam splitter reflects short wavelengths (0.6-2.3 μm) into one channel and transmits long wavelengths (2.4-5.0 μm) into another. A selection of wide, medium and narrowband filters are available. Obtaining in-orbit flats with NIRCam will be a challenge since NIRCam will not have on-board illumination lamps. Instead, we will utilize the external zodiacal light, preferentially observing along the longitudinal ecliptic plane for maximum brightness. Sky flats will allow us to verify the accuracy and stability of our ground flat fields, and they also allow us to monitor flat field properties with time. Due to the faintness of the sky, however, high signal-to-noise ratios can only be obtained within a reasonable integration time through the broad and a few of the medium-band filters. We have obtained flat-field exposures in ground testing through all filters, including narrow-band filters. Here we analyze the similarity of flats through narrow-band and medium-band filters lying within the wavelength range of broad-band filters. Proving that these flats are indistinguishable with respect to the broad-band filter will allow easier calibration and monitoring once NIRCam is in orbit.\n",13,

Link*,M. Link*; R. Douglas; C. Moriarty; A. Roman,Sessioned,Space Telescope Science Institute,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In support of the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, various teams at STScI (the Space Telescope Science Institute) have collaborated on how to re-structure the view of a an observing program within  the Astronomer’s Proposal Tool (APT) to accommodate for the differences between HST and JWST.  For HST APT programs, the structure is visit-dominant, and there is one generic form for entering observing information that spans all instruments with their required fields and options.  This can result in sometimes showing irrelevant fields to the user for a given observing goal.  Also, the generation of mosaicked observations in HST requires the user to manually calculate the position of each tile within the mosaic, accounting for positional offsets and the roll of the telescope, which is a time consuming process. Now, for JWST programs in APT, the description of the observations has been segregated by instrument and mode into discrete observing templates.  Each template’s form allows instrument specific choices and displays of relevant information.  APT will manually manage the number of visits needed to perform the observation.  This is particularly useful for mosaics and dithering with JWST. For example, users will select how they would like a mosaic to be tiled at the observation level, and the visits are automatically created. In this, visits have been re-structured to be purely informational; all editing is done at the observation level. These options and concepts are illustrated to future users via the corresponding poster.\n",14,

The pipeline is split into three stages: first, the raw data is processed into an uncalibrated slope image; second, each slope image is calibrated; and third, slope images from multiple exposures are combined and processed to produce the final data product. The final data products include: calibrated mosaics and catalogs of point sources for imaging observations; extracted spectra for LRS observations; PSF subtracted images for coronagraph observations; and spectral cubes for MRS observations. The overall goal of the MIRI pipeline is to provide well-calibrated, high level data products that maximize the scientific return from the instrument.\n",15,

No instruments have yet functioned on the sky in the planet-to-star contrast regime of the proposed coronagraph (1E-8). Therefore, starlight subtraction algorithms must be tested on a combination of simulated and laboratory data sets to give confidence that the scientific goals can be reached. The High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at Jet Propulsion Lab has carried out several technology demonstrations for the instrument concept, demonstrating 1E-8 raw (absolute) contrast. Here, we have applied a mock reference differential imaging strategy to HCIT data sets, treating one subset of images as a reference star observation and another subset as a science target observation. We show that algorithms like KLIP (Karhunen-Loève Image Projection), by suppressing residual speckles, enable the recovery of exoplanet signals at contrast of order 2E-9.\n",17,

Conti,Sessioned,Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): NASA’s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will be the first of a new generation of missions, expected to generate amounts of data unprecedented in astrophysics from space. This trend is driven by the availability of high resolution, large area detectors, commonly generating simultaneously spatial and spectral information, and the desire to have access to data in the least processed form. Although this increase in data volume is new for astrophysics missions, the data volume and associated rates are well within the realm of Earth science and other space missions.<br />While NASA currently plans to launch WFIRST into a geosynchronous orbit, there are many advantages to placing future observatories outside of Earth’s orbit at locations such as the Sun-Earth libration point L2. These advantages include a more benign radiation environment due to the absence of trapped electrons, eclipse-free Sun illumination for power generation and a stable thermal environment because of the much more slowly varying Sun angle. More importantly, a Sun-Earth libration point L2 orbit will allow for longer integration times thereby enhancing many of the WFIRST mission science cases. These advantages can be realized, if a cost effective, high capacity downlink solution is available. Here, we outline our approach to providing link capacities from L2 in excess of 3 Gbps (3x10^9 bits/s) based on existing, flight proven components. At these rates, even very large data sets can be transmitted in short data bursts, an approach that allows highly efficient scheduling of ground stations.\n",19,

The mission is an ESA / JAXA collaboration, now considered for the ESA Cosmic Visions M5 opportunity. SPICA will feature a 2.5-meter telescope cooled to below 8K, this offers the potential for 100-1000-fold advances in sensitivity beyond that obtained with Herschel and SOFIA in the far-IR. With a line sensitivity of ~5x10^-20 W/m^2 (1 h, 5 sigma), SPICA will be a complement to JWST and ALMA for deep spectroscopic observations. <br /><br />Integrated over cosmic history, star formation has occurred predominantly in dust-obscured regions which are inaccessible in the rest-frame UV and optical. Both the luminosity history and the detailed physics that govern it can only be directly measured in the mid-IR-submillimeter. Similarly, forming stars and planetary systems cool primarily through the far-IR. By taking advantage of the low-background platform, the SPICA instruments are designed for these topics. The SPICA mid-IR instrument (SMI) will provide R~50 imaging spectroscopy and R~1,000 full-band slit-fed spectroscopy from 17 to 36 microns, with a high-resolution (R=25,000) capability from 12-18 microns. The SPICA far-IR instrument (SAFARI) will cover 34 to at least 230 microns with multiple R~300 wide-band grating spectrometer modules coupling to high-sensitivity far-IR detectors. A R~3,000 scanned-etalon module will also be available for Galactic targets with bright continua and/or dense line spectra. <br /><br />SPICA has emerged with a new ESA-JAXA collaborative framework.

JAXA will provide the cryogenic system, the SMI instrument, integrate the telescope and instruments, and provide the launch vehicle. The SAFARI instrument will be provided by a consortium funded by the European national agencies led by SRON. Key detector and spectrometer contributions to SAFARI are under consideration in the US.

Of these priority science goals, the most technically challenging is the search for spectroscopic biomarkers in the atmospheres of exoplanets in the solar neighborhood. Here we present an engineering design reference mission (EDRM) for the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST), which was conceived from the start as capable of breakthrough science paired with an emphasis on cost control and cost effectiveness. An EDRM allows the engineering design trade space to be explored in depth to determine what are the most demanding requirements and where there are opportunities for margin against requirements. Our joint NASA GSFC/JPL/MSFC/STScI study team has used community-provided science goals to derive mission needs, requirements, and candidate mission architectures for a future large-aperture, non-cryogenic UVOIR space observatory. The ATLAST observatory is designed to operate at a Sun-Earth L2 orbit, which provides a stable thermal environment and excellent field of regard. Our reference designs have emphasized a serviceable 36-segment 9.2 m aperture telescope that stows within a five-meter diameter launch vehicle fairing. As part of our cost-management effort, this particular reference mission builds upon the engineering design for JWST. Moreover, it is scalable to a variety of launch vehicle fairings. Performance needs developed under the study are traceable to a variety of additional reference designs, including options for a monolithic primary mirror.<br />\n",23,

Conti,Sessioned,Northrop Grumman Corporation,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): <br />The “Search for Life” via imaging of exoplanets is a mission that requires extremely stable telescopes with apertures in the 10 m to 20 m range. The High Definition Space Telescope (HDST) envisioned for this mission would have an aperture >10 m, which is a larger payload than what can be delivered to space using a single launch vehicle. Building and assembling the mirror segments enabling large telescopes will likely require multiple launches and assembly in space. Space-based telescopes with large apertures will require major changes to system architectures.<br />The Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) for HDST is a primary mission cost driver. Enabling and affordable solutions for this next generation of large aperture space-based telescope are needed.<br />This paper reports on the concept for the Modular Orbital Demonstration of an Evolvable Space Telescope (MODEST), which demonstrates on-orbit robotic and/or astronaut assembly of a precision optical telescope in space. It will also facilitate demonstration of active correction of phase and mirror shape. MODEST is proposed to be delivered to the ISS using standard Express Logistics Carriers (ELCs) and can mounted to one of a variety of ISS pallets. Post-assembly value includes space, ground, and environmental studies, and a testbed for new instruments. This demonstration program for next generation mirror technology provides significant risk reduction and demonstrates the technology in a six-mirror phased telescope. Other key features of the demonstration include the use of an active primary optical surface with wavefront feedback control that allows on-orbit optimization and demonstration of precise surface control to meet optical system wavefront and stability requirements.<br />MODEST will also be used to evaluate advances in lightweight mirror and metering structure materials such as SiC or Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer that have excellent mechanical and thermal properties, e.g. high stiffness, high modulus, high thermal conductivity, and low thermal expansion. It has been demonstrated that mirrors built from these materials can be rapidly replicated in a highly cost effective manner, making these materials excellent candidates for a low cost, high performance OTA.\n",25,

Three different devices were evaluated to upgrade XQC’s data collection and recording system. The system takes incoming data from XQC’s pixel sensors and stores it to a memory card. The upgrade is a much smaller board and much more compact storage device. The Terasic DE0-Nano, Terasic DE0-Nano SoC, and the BeagleBone Black were tested to determine which would suit the needs of XQC best. The device needed to take incoming data, store it to an SD card, and be able to output it through a USB connection. The Terasic DE0-Nano is a simple FPGA, but needed some peripheral additions for an SD card slot and USB readout. The Terasic DE0-Nano SoC was a powerful FPGA and hard processor running Linux combined. It was able to do what was needed, but pulled too much power in the process. The BeagleBone Black had a microcontroller and also ran Linux. This last device ended up being the best choice, as it did not require too much power and had a very easy system already in place for USB readout. The only difficulty to deal with was programming the microcontroller in assembly language. This device is necessary due to the telemetry on XQC not being able to send all of the data down during the flight. It records valuable data about low energy X-rays so that the X-ray Astrophysics Groups at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Goddard Space Flight Center can analyze and resolve the spectrum of the soft X-ray background.<br />Later, using the digital logic on a Terasic DE0-Nano FPGA, a data simulator for the BeagleBone Black data collection and recording device was created. Programmed with Quartus II, the simulator uses basic digital logic components to fabricate trackable data signals and related timing signals to send to the data management device, as well as other timing signals that are asynchronous to the rest of the circuit, a failsafe enable for outputs, and several user feedback components\n",29,

Using the 2MASS catalog, we identified stars outside of the ACS/WFC field of view which cause two particular scattered light artifacts known as ""dragon's breath"" and edge glow.  We determined which regions around the chip the stars must fall in to cause dragons breath to occur and characterized the amount of stellar flux received during an integration (expressed in instrumental magnitudes) needed to cause scattering.  We have completed this study for the ACS F606W and F814W filters.  We provide a map of risky areas around the ACS chips and an upper limit of magnitudes to be concerned about. We will use these results to develop interactive tools that will aid the astronomical community in the proposal process for ACS/WFC.\n",30,

D. Miller*,A. D. Miller*; P. A. Scowen; T. Veach,Sessioned,Arizona State University; NASA Goddard,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present a hexapod stabilized focal plane as the key instrument for a proposed suborbital balloon mission. Balloon gondolas currently achieve 1-2 arcsecond pointing error, but cannot correct for unavoidable jitter movements (~50μm at 20hz) caused by wind rushing over balloon surfaces, thermal variations, cryocoolers, and reaction wheels. The jitter causes image blur during exposures and is the limiting resolution of the system. To solve this, the hexapod system actuates the focal plane to counteract the jitter through real-time closed loop feedback from star-trackers. Removal of this final jitter term decreases pointing error by an order of magnitude and allows for true diffraction-limited observation. This boost in resolution will allow for Hubble-quality imaging for a fraction of the cost. Tip-tilt pointing systems have been used for these purposes in the past, but require additional optics and introduce multiple reflections. The hexapod system, rather, is compact and can be plugged into the focal point of nearly any configuration. The design also thermally isolates the hexapod from the cryogenic focal plane enabling the use of well-established non-cryogenic hexapod technology.  High-resolution time domain multispectral imaging of the gas giant outer planets, especially in the UV range, is of particular interest to the planetary community, and a suborbital telescope with the hexapod stabilization in place would provide a wealth of new data. On an Antarctic ~100-day Long-Duration-Balloon mission the continued high-resolution imaging of gas giant storm systems would provide cloud formation and evolution data second to only a Flagship orbiter.\n",31,

This allowed possible copy/paste transcription errors from the observer’s source of orbital elements data. In order to address this issue, APT has now been improved with the capability to identify targets in and then download orbital elements from JPL Horizons. The observer will first use a target name resolver to choose the intended target from the Horizons database, and then download the orbital elements from Horizons directly into APT. A manual entry option is also still retained if the observer does not wish to use elements from Horizons. This new capability is available for HST observing, and it will also be supported for JWST observing. The poster shows examples of this new interface.\n",33,

However, no full sky coadds have yet been published which incorporate both pre and post-reactivation WISE imaging. We are creating a custom, full-sky set of coadds combining all W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation mission phases, employing the unWISE image coaddition framework (Lang 2014), which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. We anticipate that our resulting unWISE data products will have a broad range of applications, from studies of quasar variability to the identification of faint moving objects in the solar neighborhood. Using our full-depth coadds, we plan to perform W1 and W2 forced photometry at the positions of ∼400 million SDSS sources, extending to WISE depths 0.4 magnitudes fainter than previously possible.

Jacobs,Sessioned,Arizona State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): One of the most compelling questions in astrophysics today is how the process of galaxy formation unfolded during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A new generation of radio telescopes, including the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and others, are attempting to capture the redshifted 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen during the EoR. Mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is one of the core objectives of 21 cm observatories. A pressing concern of these observations is the bright foreground sources in the telescope's sidelobes outside the primary beam of the MWA. These sources, including AGN, radio galaxies and local Galactic sources, are numerous and difficult to deal with. These foreground contaminants are five orders of magnitude brighter than the redshifted 21 cm emission expected from the IGM during the EoR. The Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in New Mexico can provide sensitive characterization of these sources in the MWA’s northern sidelobe. We observed 100 bright radio sources using the JVLA in P-band and characterized these sources by extracting the spectral fits and fluxes for each source. By creating a foreground model for these data, the MWA will be able to better subtract these sources from future EoR measurements. We report the current status of the creation of the foreground model.\n",7,

D. Wilkinson*,T. D. Wilkinson*; A. Lesage,Sessioned,University of Washington; Leiden University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The stellar position angle is defined as the projection of the stellar spin axis on the night sky, as measured from North to East. Measuring the stellar position angle gives information that can be used for stellar spin axis evolution and binary formation theories. Current methods to find this angle use imaging with long baseline interferometry for fast rotating stars. There is a lack of observational techniques to find the orientation of the stellar rotation axis for slow rotating stars, which make up the vast majority of stellar population. We developed a new method for determining the absolute stellar position angle for slow rotating stars using a spectro-astrometric analysis of high resolution long-slit spectra. We used the 2m Thueringer Landessternwarte (TLS) telescope to obtain high resolution spectra (R=60,000) with multiple slit orientations to test this method. The stellar rotation causes a tilt in the stellar lines, and the angle of this tilt depends on the stellar position angle and the orientation of the slit. We used a cross-correlation method to compare the subpixel displacements of the position of the photocenter at each slit orientation with telluric lines to obtain the tilt amplitude. We report the results of finding the position angle of the slow rotating K giant Aldebaran and fast rotating reference stars like Vega.\n",1,

Standard age-dating techniques have significant degeneracies and other limitations, and in any case are mostly limited to the tiny minority of stars in bound clusters.<br /><br />Data from the Kepler and K2 surveys, along with ground-based studies, show that stellar rotation rates could potentially be exploited to determine ages of field stars since rotation declines with age; this method is called gyrochronology.

Katynski*,M. Katynski*; E. F. Guinan; S. G. Engle,Sessioned,Villanova University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Age is one of the most difficult (but important) basic stellar physical property to determine. One possible means to estimate stellar age is from rotational period; it is known that as cool stars age, they lose angular momentum from magnetic braking and slow-down. Thus, good Rotation-Age relationships exist, which are calibrated with stars possessing reliable ages from: evolutionary tracks and/or memberships in clusters/moving groups or binary star systems. Further, ages of older stars can be estimated from (low) metal abundances and kinematics (high space motions). More recently, age determinations from asteroseismology are also becoming more reliable. Except for the many G, K, M stars in the Kepler/K2 fields, rotational periods are difficult to measure photometrically for older, less active stars since star spots and active regions are smaller & less prominent.  Thus measuring the coronal X-ray activity of a star is an appealing alternative. Coronal X-ray emission is generated by the stellar dynamo, and so is directly related to the stars’ rotation (and age). Measurement of X-ray fluxes (or upper limits) have been made for most of the nearby stars (within ~20 pc) with data available in the HEASARC archives. During the 1990's the ROSAT X-Ray Satellite carried out an all-sky survey of thousands of X-ray sources, including hundreds of nearby stars, producing a large archival database. Using these and other available X-ray data from XMM-Newton & Chandra, we explore the relation between coronal X-ray activity and stellar age of all stars within 10 pc (32.6 LY), with special emphasis on dK and early dM stars that make up ~85% of the sample. Here we report the progress made in determination the ages these nearby stars. We focused on nearby dK-stars, due to their long lifetimes (>20 Gyr) and habitable zones that lie ~0.5 -1.5 AU from their host stars. They appear to be ideal candidates for hosting potentially habitable planets, making them interesting targets. We present a progress report on this project of “dating” nearby stars.

These radii are also particularly valuable in the cases of transiting exoplanet hosts because accurate stellar radii are required to determine accurate planetary radii.<br /><br />In this work, we use the BT-Settl models in combination with Johnson-Kron-Cousins VRI, 2MASS JHK, and WISE All-Sky Release photometry to produce spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to determine the temperatures and bolometric fluxes for 500 red dwarfs, most of which are in the southern sky.

In contrast, older T-Tauri stars (~ 4-10 Myr), being more difficult to find, have been less studied, even though they hold key insight to understanding evolution of lower-mass (0.1-2 M<sub>⊙</sub>) stars and of protoplanetary discs. We present a study of photometric variability of 1974 confirmed 4-10 Myr old T-Tauri stars in the Orion OB1 association using optical time-series from three different surveys: the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomía-Quest Equatorial Survey Team (CIDA-QUEST), the Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative (YETI) and from a Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) campaign. We investigated stellar rotation periods according to the type of stars (Classical or Weak-lined T-Tauri stars) and their locations, to look for population-wide trends. We detected 563 periodic variables and 1411 non-periodic variables by investigating the light curves of these stars. We find that ~ 30% of Weak-line T-Tauri stars (WTTS) and ~ 20% of Classical T-Tauri stars (CTTS) are periodic. Though we did not find any noticeable difference in rotation period between CTTS and WTTS, our study does show a change in the overall rotation periods of stars 4-10 Myr old, consistent with predictions of angular momentum evolution models, an important constraint for theoretical models for an age range for which no similar data existed.\n",10,

Hill*,M. Hill*; A. A. West,Sessioned,Gettysburg College; Boston University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We investigate the connection between activity and variability in a large sample of M Dwarfs for which we have approximately 75 repeat observations.  These low luminosity stars have previously been studied using both photometric and spectroscopic data. With a deeper understanding of how variability correlates with magnetic activity, we may be able to determine spectroscopic properties of stars with time domain photometric data alone.  We used 9 years of five-band photometric data for over 25,000 spectroscopically observed M dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82.  Using H-alpha emission as the indicator for magnetic activity strength, we find that activity appears to be a predictor of variability but the relationship changes as a function of spectral type.  In early-type M dwarfs (M0-M2), stars with high levels of activity show larger amounts of variability, while in mid-type M dwarfs (M3-M5), we find that as the magnetic activity increases, the variability decreases.  We also find that early-type M dwarfs show a larger fraction of possible activity cycles, where their variability changes during the 9 years of observations.\n",11,

Hotton*,K. Hotton*; S. H. Saar,Sessioned,"Harvard-Smithsonian, CfA; University of Southampton","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We wish to explore, under various stellar conditions, how aggregate starspot properties change when spot emergence rates are high. We use a Sun-based model to simulate the emergence, motion and decay of starspots on active stars. The spots are generated with a solar log-normal distribution of areas, and the emergence rate scaled according to the stellar rotation rate. The initial longitude of each spot is generated randomly, and initial latitude is generated with a normal distribution about a changing average, equivalent to the solar butterfly diagram. The spots are then allowed to decay at a rate dependent on the stars' surface turbulence, with a motion determined by the differential rotation and meridional flow. At high emergence rates spots can erupt into old ones, where we will either experience a merger or (partial) destruction, depending on their polarity. We follow this evolution over a magnetic cycle, logging the resulting distribution of spot sizes, latitudes, decay rates and destruction (flare) rates, for varying input parameters and stellar conditions. We compare our results with both stellar observations (including light curves, apparent spot distributions, measured differential rotation and flare rates) and theoretical estimates such as magnetic diffusivities.\n",12,

Very few ultracool dwarfs have detected levels of radio emission, so increasing the sample size is important for the understanding the variety of magnetic processes at work. Because of the dramatic variations in radio and X-ray properties, these probes are best done with simultaneous measurements. We report on a small sample of ultracool dwarfs that have been observed simultaneously with XMM Newton Observatory and the Jansky Very Large Array, for constraints on their coronal plasmas through X-ray and radio observations, respectively; we present the results of the radio reduction, calibration and imaging of our sample. We discuss the implications of upper limits and detections for increasing our understanding of magnetic field behavior in this regime.\n",14,

Deam*,S. Deam*; T. Stercula; E. Maier,Sessioned,University of Iowa,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Radio emission from active stars provides a sensitive measure of stellar coronal characteristics such as temperature, density and magnetic field strengths. Gyro-synchrotron (GS) emission from mildly relativistic electrons spiraling in magnetic fields is commonly detected in hot coronae of stars with extended magnetospheres, and allows for quantitative estimates of coronal features. Another radiation mechanism, thermal gyro-synchrotron (TGS) radiation, which arises from the thermal electron populations in the high energy tail of a Maxwellian energy distribution, depends strongly on the coronal temperature and strength of the magnetic field. Thus, TGS can potentially provide sensitive constraints on these physical parameters. However, TGS radiation has never been observed.<br />    Models predict that TGS should be characterized by an increase in flux, and a corresponding sharp increase in fractional circular polarization at high frequencies. Using the Very Large Array (VLA), we observed eight stars of three different classes: pre-main sequence stars, classical flare stars and close binaries, to determine if their spectral energy distributions (SED’s) might display these distinguishing features. The VLA observations were made using 4 GHz wide frequency bands between 15 GHz and 44 Ghz, measuring both Stokes I flux and V flux.<br />    For six of the eight stars, the results from VLA are consistent with the SED’s we expect for GS, not TGS. For the two pre-main sequence stars, we measured a significant increase in the fractional circular polarization at the higher frequency bands. We are in the process of building detailed modeled fits to determine if we can attribute this to TGS. The development of comprehensive models describing SED’s for all of the observed stars will allow us to set upper limits constraining the magnetic field strengths for each source, and, in the case of potential TGS detection, refine TGS models.<br />\n",15,

Observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths of the main impulsive flare and subsequent smaller events reveal a complex pattern of flare events extending over about three weeks. We find that the X-ray spectrum of the primary outburst can be adequately described by either a single very high temperature plasma or a nonthermal thick-target bremmstrahlung model. By evaluating accompanying data of this event and analysis of a second brightening, we argue that the thermal interpretation is more likely on energetic grounds. The primary outburst lasted a few hours and produced the highest temperature thermal plasmas ever seen spectroscopically over the 0.3-100 keV range in a stellar flare, at T<sub>X</sub> of 300 MK. The X-ray luminosity of the main flare exceeded the bolometric luminosity of the brighter component (L<sub>X</sub> >1.6L<sub>bol</sub>) for ~360 seconds. The first event was followed by a comparably energetic event almost a day later, whose coverage at X-ray and optical wavelengths enables inferences about it and the first event. In particular we find evidence for stellar radius-sized coronal loops filled with dense (n<sub>e</sub>>10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) coronal plasma. The radiated energy in X-rays and white light reveal these first two events to be some of the most energetic X-ray and white light flares from an M dwarf. These structures require large coronal magnetic field strengths (a few kG for the first event, hundreds of Gauss for the second) to confine the plasma, and we thus predict an extremely high photospheric magnetic field strength of several kiloGauss.\n",16,

All systems have trigonometric parallaxes of 100 mas or more with errors of 10 mas or less. Included in the sample are 12 systems in the southern sky added to the sample via new parallaxes from the RECONS (REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars, www.recons.org) effort at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m.<br /><br />The census consists of 366 stars (including the Sun and white dwarfs), 37 brown dwarfs, and 34 planets (eight in our Solar System and 26 exoplanets). Red dwarfs clearly dominate the sample, accounting for 75% of all stars known within 10 pc, while brown dwarfs are currently outnumbered 10 to 1 by stars. The completeness of the sample is assessed, indicating that additional discoveries of red, brown, and white dwarfs within 10 pc, both as primaries and secondaries, are likely, although we estimate that roughly 90% of the stellar systems<br />have been identified. The evolution of the 10 pc sample over the past 70 years is outlined to illustrate the growth of the sample. <br /><br />The luminosity and mass functions are described. In contrast to many studies, once all known close multiples are resolved into individual components, the true stellar mass function rises to the end of the main sequence. With far fewer brown dwarfs than stars, different formation scenarios for objects that fuse hydrogen and those that do not are likely. Of 270 stellar primaries, 28% have companion stars, only 2% have brown dwarf companions, and 6% have detected planets. The planetary rate so far is low but climbing, while searches for<br />brown dwarf companions to stars within 10 pc have been quite rigorous, so the brown dwarf companion rate is unlikely to rise noticeably. Overall, the solar neighborhood is dominated by small stars that are potentially orbited by many small, as yet unseen, planets.<br /><br />This effort has been supported by the NSF through grants AST-0908402, AST-1109445, and AST-1412026, and via observations made possible by the SMARTS Consortium.\n",1,

Furthermore, such a sample provides insight into the local star formation history. Towards that end, the Research Consortium on Nearby Stars (RECONS) team measures trigonometric parallaxes to establish which systems truly lie within the Solar Neighborhood, emphasizing those within 25 pc. Less accurate photometric and spectroscopic estimates previously suggested LP 991-84, LHS 6167AB, and LHS 2880 as possible members of the 10-pc sample, which made them desirable candidates.<br />Recent measurements with the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9-m telescope place LP 991-84 and LHS 6167AB at 8.6 ± 0.1 and 9.68 ± 0.09 pc, respectively, which is consistent with earlier estimates of their distances. However, the final parallax for LHS 2880 places it beyond 25 pc, at a distance of 31 ± 1 pc, despite its previous identification as a member of the 10-pc sample. The proper motions of these systems are 0.2589 ± 0.0004, 0.4394 ± 0.0003, and 0.7113 ± 0.0009 arcsec yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.<br />To characterize these systems more fully, the RECONS team obtained VRI photometry for each; they range from 13.8–14.5 mag. in V. LHS 6167AB also shows signs of long-term variability in V, including a possible flare. In addition, CTIO 1.5-m spectroscopy identifies LP 991-84 and LHS 6167AB as M4.5 V systems.<br />Even as we aspire to identify all the stars within 25 pc, we find that the 10-pc volume still holds some surprises.<br />NSF grants AST 05-07711 and AST 09-08402, NASA-SIM, Georgia State University, the University of Virginia, Hampden-Sydney College, and the Levinson Fund of the Peninsula Community Foundation supported this research.

The program has obtained up to 15 years of observations in the V band for hundreds of M dwarf stars. This unique study has provided insight into how the ubiquitous M dwarfs change over decadal timescales, revealing their long-term magnetic cycles and how the presence or lack of such activity may affect their sizes and consequent luminosities, and thus their positions on the H-R Diagram.<br /><br />Using carefully vetted parallaxes and photometric colors, many measured by the RECONS team, we have created a highly accurate H-R Diagram of the nearest (within 25pc) stars using their V-K colors to represent temperatures and absolute V magnitudes as proxies for luminosities. We find that for M dwarfs, the main sequence widens significantly, by up to four magnitudes in M<sub>V</sub>, corresponding to a factor of almost 40 in optical flux. This spread implies a wide range of stellar radii for M dwarfs of the same temperature. Our study of long-term photometric variability indicates that there is a trend in cyclic activity that is highest for the most luminous red dwarfs and lowest for the rare, cool red subdwarfs.

Some blue L dwarfs are subdwarfs with low metallicity spectral features such as greater H<sub>2</sub> absorption, stronger metal hydride bands, and enhanced TiO absorption (Burgasser et al 2008c). We fit 3<sup>rd</sup> order polynomials to  the pseudo-continuum in order to provide a quantitative comparison of spectral morphology with other peculiar L dwarfs, field standards, young L dwarfs, and L subdwarf. The results indicated that the coefficients of the fit correlate with spectral type, but are independent of color. This newly found trend provides a parameter which can be utilized as an additional tool in characterizing quantifiable differences in the spectra of brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this method can be applied in studying the atmospheric properties of exoplanets, given their similarities with brown dwarfs in mass and photospheric properties.\n",12,

It has been previously suggested that there may be an “F Dwarf Oasis,” where the BD Desert observed for Solar-like stars ceases to exist for F dwarf stars. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has compiled a catalog of ~400 of its most compelling stellar and substellar companion candidates orbiting host stars of various spectral types and evolutionary states. Among these candidates, approximately 100 had a derived companion mass in the BD regime (13-80 M<sub>Jup</sub>), which is a significant increase compared to the number of known small separation (a < 1 AU) BD companions. Our sample appears to manifest the BD desert, but only for seperations < 0.2 AU rather than the previously held 5 AU. This is explained by one of the unique qualities of our sample when compared to previous companions surveys: Two-thirds of the BD candidates in our sample are orbiting evolved stars, most of which were F dwarfs during their main sequence lifetime, consistent with the notion of an F Dwarf Oasis. Using this sample, we further test this hypothesis by constraining the formation mechanisms of BD companions, and exploring their orbital evolution as their host evolves off the main sequence.\n",13,

The presence of extreme colors for some L dwarfs suggests that secondary parameters like gravity, metallicity, and clouds influence their spectral morphology. Although some red L dwarfs have low-gravity signatures in their optical spectra (indicating a young object) and some blue L dwarfs have low metallicity spectral features (indicating a subdwarf), many color outliers do not exhibit clear-cut spectral diagnostics. We investigate the spread in color for these objects by comparing spectral line measurements for outliers with confirmed young objects, known subdwarfs, and near-infrared spectral standards to elucidate their underlying atmospheric and physical properties. We use high-resolution NIRSPEC J-band spectra to measure the equivalent width, line depth, and full width at half maximum of four KI absorption lines that are susceptible to pressure-broadening and therefore sensitive to differences in temperature, gravity, and metallicity.

Douglas,Sessioned,CUNY Graduate Center; AMNH; Columbia University; CUNY College of Staten Island,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that cool over time because they are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion at their cores. While spectral types (M, L, T, Y) generally correlate with decreasing temperature, spectral subclasses (T0, T1, T2, etc.) do not, suggesting that secondary parameters (gravity, metallicity, dust) play a role in the spectral type-temperature relationship. We investigate this relationship for T dwarfs, which make up the coolest fully-populated spectral class of substellar objects. Our sample consists of 154 T dwarfs with low resolution (R~75-100) near-infrared (~0.8-2.5 micron) spectra from the SpeX Prism Library and the literature. We compare each observed spectrum to synthetic spectra from four model grids using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine robust best-fit parameters and uncertainties. We evaluate the best fit parameters from each model grid per object to constrain how spectral type relates to decreasing temperature and increasing surface gravity and to compare the consistency of each model grid. To test for discrepant results when fitting to relatively narrow wavelength ranges, this analysis is performed on the full spectrum of the Y, J, H, and K bands and on each band separately. New detections of cooler objects extending into the Y dwarf and exoplanet regimes motivate our model comparisons and search for trends with spectral type and other observational properties across the decreasing temperatures in order to better understand the atmospheres of substellar objects, including cool gas giant exoplanets.\n",17,

Reyes*,A. Reyes*; J. Ge; N. Thomas; B. Ma; M. F. Heslar,Sessioned,University of Florida; United States Air Force Academy,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): While searching for exoplanets via the transit method, it has been documented that the periodicity of an unresolved background eclipsing binary (BEB) can be misinterpreted as the orbital companion of a target star. We explore the possibility that this false-positive contamination method can also occur in Doppler surveys if the angular separation between a BEB and a selected primary is under a certain threshold, dependent on the fiber diameter of the spectrometer instrument. The case example of this investigation is a K2 giant in the constellation Cygnus, in the region of overlap of the <i>Kepler</i> and MARVELS surveys. This star was originally flagged for potentially having a 5.56d period companion as per the <i>Kepler</i> transit photometry. It was also imbricated with radial velocity (RV) observations performed by the SDSS-III MARVELS survey, in which Doppler information was extracted from along the dispersion direction of the fiducially-calibrated, post-pipeline-rendered spectra. The 5.56d period was corroborated after testing its probability against that of others via a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. The pipeline mass determination yielded a ~17 M<sub>Jupiter</sub> companion, within the characteristic mass-range of brown dwarfs. The MARVELS results seem to constitute an independent discovery, and hence confirmation, of the brown dwarf candidate. However, a later investigation conducted by EXPERT, intent upon refining the system’s physical parameters, failed to identify the RV signal of any companion whatsoever. EXPERT, with its superior resolving power (R=30,000 vs R=11,000 in MARVELS), finer fiber width (1.2 vs 1.9 arcsec), and higher degree of precision (~10 m/s), was expected to finalize the confirmation, but now offers a major challenge to previous models of the system. Additionally, high-resolution adaptive optics imaging reveals the presence of a distinct, close-in object. The object may itself be an unbound BEB, and thus the source of the period signals reported by <i>Kepler</i> and MARVELS. Further endeavors are underway to better understand the underlying theoretical explanation for the possible false-detections, currently attributed to differential fiber aperture, which may have implications for future Doppler surveys.\n",20,

One way to measure mass loss rates is through studying the infrared bow shocks from massive O and B type stars. These stars form bow shocks because they have been expelled from their birth regions and are moving at high velocities through the ISM. The stars we studied in this project were discovered by searching the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 μm atlas.

A small but significant fraction of these massive stars have been observed to be high-velocity runaway stars moving rapidly away from their origin. When these stars encounter nebular gas they create characteristic arc-shaped bowshocks of heated compressed dust and gas. Using the distinct infrared emission morphology of the hot dust, these bowshock nebulae are predicted to give the location of the massive early type stars.<br />Visual inspection of 24-micron band images from the Spitzer Mapping of the Outer Galaxy (SMOG) revealed 12 new bowshock nebula candidates.

This stellar class has recently regained  the spotlight because of the directly-imaged  planets  around a confirmed Lambda Boo star, HR 8799, and a suggested Lambda Boo star Beta Pictoris.  The discovery of a giant asteroid  belt around  Vega, another possible Lambda Boo star, also suggests hidden planets.  This possible link between Lambda Boo stars and planet-bearing stars motivates us to study Lambda Boo stars systematically.  Since the peculiar nature of the prototype Lambda Bootis was first noticed in 1943, Lambda Boo candidates  published  in the literature  have been  selected using widely different criteria.  The Lambda Boo label has been applied to almost any peculiar A-type stars that do not fit elsewhere. In order to determine the origin of Lambda Boo stars’ unique abundance  pattern and to better discriminate between theories explaining the Lambda Boo phenomenon,  a consistent  working definition  of Lambda Boo stars is needed. We have  re-evaluated all published  Lambda Boo candidates and their available ultraviolet  and visible spectra.  Using observed and synthetic spectra, we explored the classification of Lambda Boo stars and developed quantitative criteria that discriminate metal-poor stars from bona fide Lambda Boo stars.  With model spectra, we demonstrated  that the (C I 1657 Angstrom)/ (Al II 1671 Angstrom) line ratio is the best single criterion to distinguish between Lambda Boo stars and metal weak stars, and that one cannot use a single C I/Al II cut-off value as a Lambda Boo classification criterion.  The C I/Al II cut-off  value is a function of a star’s effective temperature  and metallicity. Using these stricter Lambda Boo classification criteria, we concluded that neither Beta Pictoris nor Vega should be classified as Lambda  Boo stars.<br />\n",7,

The best set of lines in the FUSE spectral region are Fe III (UV1), V III 1150 Å, and Cr III 1137 Å. The abundances of these elements in early B stars are a marker for recent SNe Ia activity, as a single exploding white dwarf can deliver 0.5 solar masses of Ni-56 that decays into Fe to the ISM. The Fe group abundances in an older population of stars primarily reflect SNe II activity, in which a single explosion delivers only 0.07 solar masses of Ni-56 to the ISM (the rest remains trapped in the neutron star). The abundances of the Fe group elements in early B stars not only track SNe Ia activity but are also important for computing evolutionary tracks for massive stars. In general, the Fe abundance relative to the sun’s value is comparable to the mean abundances for the lighter elements in the Clouds/Bridge but the values of [V,Cr/Fe]<sub>sun</sub> are smaller. This presentation will discuss the spatial distribution of the Fe Group elements in the Magellanic Clouds, and compare it with our galaxy in which the abundance of Fe declines with radial distance from the center.

R. Cowley*,C. R. Cowley*,Sessioned,Univ. of Michigan,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We explore an old idea for the origin of Am star anomalies, possibly related to observations of pollution in white dwarfs (Jura & Young, ARAA, 42, 45, 2014; Gansicke, et al., Arxiv:1505.03142). It must be noted that infall of an earthlike body can explain some, but not all of the abundance anomalies of Am stars.<br /><br />The ingestion of earthlike material by an a star should have observable effects that are larger than for solar-type stars. We follow dynamical arguments discussed, e.g. by Debes, et al. ApJ., 747, 148, 2012), and postulate that gravitational interactions will produce an infalling stream of low angular<br />momentum bodies.<br /><br />Note that most if not all Am stars are binary. Here we investigate only whether there is an increased frequency of collisions with a close binary relative to a single star.<br /><br />We make quantitative estimates, using analytical 2-body solutions and restricted 3-body calculations with parameters similar to those of the eclipsing Am pair Beta Aur,or WW Aur. We use initial values for the binary similar to those which would lead to a certain collision on a (4M_sun) single star for a parabolic trajectory. All calculations begin with a distance from the center of mass along the axis of a paraboloid of revolution at 3 or 5 AU and such that a marginal collision occurs with a single star. The perpendicular area of this figure is a cross section for a collision. We sample trajectories starting within and near this cross section, for double star<br />systems. Based on many trials we find it about equally likely-- relative to a single star--that an incoming body will be ejected from the system than that it will collide with one of the stars. Although we have sampled only a fraction of possible parameter space, we find no basis to expect that the binarity of the Am systems makes them more likely to have ingested planetary material.<br /><br />Infall should probably still be considered, along with the generally accepted diffusion scenario, but it does not appear that the binarity of Am stars makes infall significantly more relevant.\n",9,

Spectra obtained at ESO with UVES found in the archives for Feige 86 and recent ESPaDOnS spectra from CFHT obtained by the authors for the four other stars of the sample are analysed. Since atomic diffusion can occur in the atmospheres of hot BHB stars, this study aims to verify if vertical abundance stratification is present in these stars. The abundance of each selected atomic line is obtained by line fitting using the ZEEMAN2 code. Since the various atomic lines of a given species are formed at different depths in the atmosphere, a search for potential vertical abundance stratification is therefore possible. Average abundances are also estimated, along with the rotational and radial velocities of each star. When possible, these values are compared to previous studies.\n",10,

Recent two-dimensional simulations have shown that the plasmoid instability onsets during partially ionized reconnection [1-4]. We use the plasma-neutral module of the HiFi framework to simulate the nonlinear evolution of the plasmoid instability during symmetric and asymmetric reconnection. These simulations model the plasma and neutrals as separate fluids and include ionization, recombination, charge exchange, thermal conduction, and the Hall effect. The Hall effect leads to the development of significant out-of-plane magnetic fields in the current sheet region in the laminar phase, but we do not observe shortening of the current sheet or significant acceleration of the reconnection rate as a result. After the onset of the plasmoid instability, structure develops on scales comparable to the ion inertial length. We compare simulations of the plasmoid instability with and without the Hall effect to determine its impact on the reconnection process. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts to connect these simulations with solar observations and laboratory experiments.<br />[1] Leake et al. 2012, ApJ, 760, 109 [2] Leake et al. 2013, PhPl, 20, 062102 [3] Ni et al. 2015, ApJ, 799, 79 [4] Murphy & Lukin 2015, ApJ, 805, 134\n",3,

Miller*,M. Miller*; H. V. Frey,Sessioned,Virginia Tech; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Chryse Basin’s location in the northern hemisphere of Mars allowed it to collect water from a number of major outflow channels. These outflows likely deposited significant amounts of sediment within the Basin. This project’s goal was to see if mapping buried impact craters, revealed as Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs) in Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data, could be used to determine the distribution and variation of sediment thickness within the Basin. QCDs, including likely buried impact craters, were mapped to test the hypothesis that further into the basin there would be fewer smaller craters because thicker sediments would have preferentially covered them. Mapping was done using Gridview, an interactive graphics program that manipulates data, in this case topographic data from MOLA. It should be possible to estimate the thickness of the sediment from the smallest buried craters found in a given area, and therefore map out the change in sediment thickness across the basin. The smallest QCDs beginning to be completely covered by sediment were just below 30 km in diameter. The minimum sediment needed to cover a QCD of this size was calculated to be between 1-2km. Therefore, the absence of QCDs below 30 km in the NE corner of Chryse could be explained by sediment at least that thick. Lower thickness is expected elsewhere in the basin, especially in the SW, where more QCDs with smaller diameters were found. The method of mapping buried impact craters provides a way to determine variations in sediment thickness within the Chryse Basin. This method could be used on other sediment-covered areas to learn about past water flow.\n",7,

Ivar’s large size and close approach to Earth in 2013 (minimum distance 0.32 AU) provided an opportunity to observe the asteroid over many different viewing angles for an extended period of time, which we have utilized to generate a shape and thermophysical model of Ivar, allowing us to discuss the implications that these results have on the regolith of this asteroid.    <br />Using the software SHAPE [2,3], we updated the nonconvex shape model of Ivar, which was constructed by Kaasalainen et al. [4] using photometry.  We incorporated 2013 radar data and CCD lightcurves using the Arecibo Observatory’s 2380Mz radar and the 0.35m telescope at the Palmer Divide Station respectively, to create a shape model with higher surface detail.  We found Ivar to be elongated with maximum extended lengths along principal axes of 12 x 5 x 6 km and a rotation rate of 4.795162 ± 5.4 * 10<sup>-6</sup> hrs [5]. <br />In addition to these radar data and lightcurves, we also observed Ivar in the near IR using the SpeX instrument at the NASA IRTF.  These data cover a wide range of Ivar’s rotational longitudes and viewing geometries.  We have used SHERMAN [6,7] with input parameters such as the asteroid’s IR emissivity, optical scattering law, and thermal inertia, in order to complete thermal computations based on our shape model and known spin state.  Using this procedure, we find which reflective, thermal, and surface properties best reproduce the observed spectra.  This allows us to characterize properties of the asteroid’s regolith and study heterogeneity of the surface.

Sharkey*,B. Sharkey*; E. L. Ryan; C. E. Woodward; K. S. Noll,Sessioned,University of Minnesota - Twin Cities; U. Maryland; NASA Goddard,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Hilda asteroids are a unique population of small bodies that are locked in a 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unlike other resonances in the asteroid belt, the 3:2 is a stable resonance at 3.95 AU. Objects at this resonance have stable orbits for at least 2 GYr and, more likely, for the age of the Solar System. In an instantaneous top down view of the solar system, the Hildas approximately trace a triangle with over-densities of asteroids near the L3, L4 and L5 Jovian Lagrange points. This configuration is cited as evidence that Jupiter migrated inwards by ~0.4 AU. Stable Hilda orbits have mean eccentricities of 0.16 with typical perihelia of 3.15 AU. These latter properties, in terms of observability and accessibility to spacecraft, are a major advantage that distinguishes the Hildas from other populations of potential scientific interest such as the Jovian Trojans. The Outer Main Belt (OMB) also has many objects that may have originated in the outer protoplanetary disk (OPD). However, the OMB appears to be more mixed with objects from elsewhere in the Main Belt and enjoys only a small advantage in terms of brightness for a given diameter and albedo. The intrinsic collisional probability for objects in the Hilda population is also a factor of 3 to 5 less than the collisional probabilities for Trojan and OMB populations. Thus, the Hildas likely represent a significant population of objects unaltered due to collisional processing. Here we discuss findings of our ongoing NASA Planetary Astronomy program to obtain Sloan optical (g' r’ i’ z’) colors of Hilda-group asteroids. The loci of these colors are compared to the Kuiper Belt populations to test post-formation migration effects of the giant planets in our solar system on the small body population.

Approximately half of the objects discussed here were studied using densely sampled lightcurves (French <i>et al. </i>2015a, b); Stephens <i>et al.</i> 2015), and the other half were sparse lightcurves obtained by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; Waszcazk <i> et al. </i>2015).<br /> <br />A significant fraction (~40%) of the objects in the ground-based sample rotate slowly (P > 24h), with measured periods as long as 375 h (Warner and Stephens 2011).

In a nearly circular orbit around 6 AU, outside of the water-sublimation zone, SW1 is continuously active and experiences frequent outbursts. Our group’s effort is focusing on finding constraints on physical and dynamical properties of SW1’s nucleus and their incorporation into a thermophysical model [1,2] to explain this behavior. We are currently analyzing coma morphology of SW1 before, during, and after outburst placing constraints on the spin-pole direction, spin period, and surface areas of activity. In addition, we are using the thermal model to investigate if the continuous activity comes from one or multiple processes, such as the release of trapped supervolatiles during the amorphous to crystalline (A-C) water ice phase transition and/or the direct sublimation of pockets of supervolatile ices. The supervolatile ices may be primordial or from the condensation of gases released during the A-C phase transition. To explain the possibly quasi-periodic but frequent outbursts, we are looking into subsurface cavities where internal pressures can build, reaching and exceeding surrounding material strengths [3,4] and/or thermal waves reaching a pocket of supervolatile ices, causing a rapid increase in the sublimation rate. For all these phenomena, the model is constrained by comparing the output dust mass loss rate and its variability with what has been observed through optical imaging of the comet at various points in its orbit. We will present preliminary thermal modeling of a homogeneous progenitor nucleus that evolves into a body showing internal material layering, the generation of CO and CO2 ice pockets, and the production of outbursts, thus bringing us closer to explaining the behavior of this intriguing comet.

Cangi*,E. Cangi*; D. M. Abrams,Sessioned,University of Oregon; Northwestern University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): While theories of synchronization in two- or three-body astronomical systems are well understood, a generalization to many-bodied systems remains largely unexplored. Historically, problems of resonant capture among astronomical bodies have been treated primarily using methods from conservative classical mechanics. We investigate the possibility of using nonconservative models together with perturbation theory and numerical methods to understand the phenomenon of resonant capture in large-scale structures such as rings, planetary systems and galactic spiral arms. In particular, we focus on <i>N</i>-body dissipative systems such as circumplanetary discs and use methods drawn from the study of coupled oscillators. One such method is inspired by the Kuramoto model, which describes mean-field behavior in large ensembles of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The Kuramoto model can be modified to allow for non-mean-field coupling, leading to the existence of chimera states, in which most of the oscillators synchronize. These chimera states can appear as clusters or spirals of synced oscillators, and may be suggestive of objects in astronomical contexts. As an illustrative example, we develop a mean-field model for <i>N</i> small particles in a dust ring around a massive planet and integrate it numerically using code developed in MATLAB and Python. Preliminary results show promise that this approach will yield new insight into astronomical synchronization phenomena across a wide range of length scales.\n",14,

By measuring the positions of an asteroid in a set of images, we can reduce the overall uncertainty in the accepted orbital parameters of that object. These measurements, using our WestRock Observatory (WRO) and several other telescopes around the world, are being published through the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and benefit the global community.<br />Three different methods are used to obtain these observations. First, we use our own 24-inch telescope at WRO, located in at CSU’s Coca-Cola Space Science Center in downtown Columbus, Georgia . Second, we have access to data from the 20-inch telescope at Stone Edge Observatory in El Verano, California. Finally, we may request images remotely using Skynet, an online worldwide network of robotic telescopes. Our primary and long-time collaborator on Skynet has been the “41-inch” reflecting telescope at Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin.

Spectral contrast in statistically significant detections of the 10-μm feature ranges from 1% ± 0.1% to 8.5% ± 0.9%. Comparison with the spectra of primitive meteorites (McAdam et al. 2015, Icarus, 245, 320) suggests asteroids in both families are similar to meteorites with lower abundances of phyllosilicates. We used the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model to derive diameters, beaming parameters and albedos for our sample. Asteroids in both families have beaming parameters near unity and low to moderate albedos. We find that contrast of the silicate emission feature is not correlated with asteroid diameter; however, higher 10-μm contrast may be associated with flatter spectral slopes in the near-infrared. The spectra of both families are consistent with icy bodies with some amount of fine-grained silicates, but with coarser grains or denser surface structure than Trojan asteroids and comets. The range of spectral contrast of the 10-μm emission feature within each family suggests diversity in regolith porosity and/or grain size.\n",16,

This observation was targeted to probing a high energy extension of the X-ray continuum component detected from the Jovian aurorae by XMM-Newton, while the previous in-situ observation by the Ulysses failed to detect hard X-ray emission in the 27-48 keV band. NuSTAR has the unique capabilities of spatially resolving the two polar regions above 10 keV and detecting a spectral break which is expected between the XMM-Newton and Ulysses energy band. With 100 ksec exposure, our detection of X-ray emission from the south pole was only marginal possibly due to time variation of the auroral X-ray emission, while the north pole was hidden during our observation. In this poster,  we present our imaging and spectral analysis, then discuss follow-up deeper NuSTAR observations.\n",17,

These S-shaped density structures are caused by moonlets embedded in Saturn's rings which are not massive enough to clear and maintain a complete circumferential gap like the larger ring-moons Pan and Daphnis do (Spahn, Sremcevic, 2000 and Spahn,Sremcevic, Duschl, 2002).

The advent of ALMA provides the opportunity to observe rotational transitions in this molecule and many of its isotopologues with unprecendented sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study we make use of publicly available ALMA calibration observations of Titan taken between April and July 2014, each lasting around 160 seconds.

J. White*,A. J. White*; D. Ebel,Sessioned,American Museum of Natural History,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The NASA Stardust mission to comet Wild 2 returned to Earth in 2006 with cometary and interstellar material captured in aerogel. Cometary particles impacted an aerogel collector at a relative velocity of 6.1 km/s, creating three-dimensional (3D) impact tracks of melted and crushed aerogel, void space, and fragmented cometary material. Each track represents the history of a unique hypervelocity capture event. The nature of each impact, including the original state of the impactor, is recorded in track morphology and material distribution. Using a combination of 3D morphological data, chemical data, and microphysical models, it is possible to reconstruct track formation events and a model of the original impactor.<br /><br />The focus of this work is to fully characterize whole tracks both morphologically and chemically using solely non-destructive methods. To achieve this, we combine high-resolution laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) 3D imaging with synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) chemical mapping. We are also beginning to incorporate Raman spectroscopy to perform mineral phase analysis of fine track wall material. Using a Zeiss LSM 710 LSCM located in the American Museum of Natural History, we have imaged the morphology of over a dozen, whole Stardust tracks at high resolution (<80 nm/pixel in XY). We obtain the distribution of fine material along the track walls both quickly and without disturbing the sample. Complementary chemical data is acquired using the GSECARS X-ray microbe on beamline 13-IDE at the Advance Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. X-ray fluorescence maps of each track were collected with 100ms/pixel dwell time at a resolution of 1 or 2 micron/pixel. Many tracks were tilted and mapped a second time for stereo measurements.<br /><br />A thorough understanding of how cometary material and aerogel is distributed along tracks is required to understand the events which occurred after impact and to back-calculate properties of the original impactor using hydrodynamic simulations of hypervelocity impacts in aerogel.

Belfast; Open Univ.,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Cometary nuclei are some of the least reflective natural objects in the Solar System, although the number of comets for which the reflectivity has heretofore actually been measured is small due to the difficulty of the requisite measurements. When no other information is present, it is common to assume a geometric albedo of 4%, and this is consistent with the limited number of known albedos. However the true average albedo, median albedo, and spread of the distribution are not well constrained. Knowing the ensemble properties of cometary albedos would aid in understanding the surface scattering properties as well as the interior thermal evolution and surface evolution of the population. We present here a preliminary estimate of the distribution of geometric albedos among the Jupiter-family comet (JFC) population. We make use of and build on the results of the Survey of Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei (SEPPCoN), in which we obtained new and independent estimates of the radii of 89 JFCs [1,2]. We will present our preliminary albedo estimates for ~50 JFC nuclei (by far the most ever obtained), and we will discuss the implications of the ensemble of the results. These JFCs were all observed in R-band, and were all observed at relatively large heliocentric distances (usually >4 AU from the Sun) where the comets appeared inactive, thus minimizing coma contamination.

Timmes,Sessioned,Arizona State University; Joint Institue for Nuclear Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The final fate of stars between ~1.0M<sub>⊙</sub> and ~7.0M<sub>⊙</sub> is an electron degenerate carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD). These WD stars play a key role in stellar and galaxy evolution, as cosmological distance indicators, iron-group element factories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic energy sources, and the terminus of stellar binary evolution. However, the thermonuclear reaction rates used in these models have compounded uncertainties that can affect the final characteristics of the white dwarf. While the reaction rates are derived from experiment when possible, some crucial reactions have yet to be reproduced experimentally at energies relevant for astrophysics. We investigate the sensitivity of the WD’s structure and composition to the composite uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates using the stellar evolution toolkit, Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). A dense grid of stellar models is evolved from the pre-main sequence to the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. We use a sophisticated nuclear reaction network that follows 49 isotopes from <sup>1</sup>H to <sup>34</sup>S with Monte Carlo sampled reaction rates from STARLIB to provide the first statistically rigorous study of the final characteristics of WDs.\n",1,

Vasquez Soto*,A. Vasquez Soto*; B. Barlow,Sessioned,High Point University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Hot subdwarf stars were once main sequence stars, like the sun, that deviated from normal stellar evolution due to binary interactions and evolved into extreme horizontal branch stars. Several of these stars exhibit rapid pulsations driven by iron opacity instabilities. CS 1246 is a rapidly pulsating hot subdwarf discovered in 2009 that is dominated by a single 371 second pulsation. At the time of its discovery, the pulsational amplitude was one of the largest known, making CS 1246 an ideal candidate for follow up studies. Observations in 2013 implied that the pulsational amplitude had decreased significantly. Since then we have continued monitoring the star using the robotic SKYNET telescopes in Chile, in order to further characterize any changes. Our recent observations show that the pulsational amplitude has gone down by a factor of six: CS 1246 is barely a pulsator anymore. The decay in amplitude over time is reminiscent of a damped harmonic oscillator. Here we present six years of photometry for CS 1246 and discuss  possible scenarios that might explain its interesting behavior.\n",5,

RRL stars are of particular interest because they are standard candles and can be used to map out structure in the galaxy. The periods and shape of RRL light curves also contain information about their Oosterhoff type, which can probe galactic formation history, and metallicity respectively. Although there have been several large photometric surveys for RR Lyrae in the nearby galaxy (OGLE, NSVS, ASAS, and MACHO to name a few), they have each been limited in either sky coverage or number of epochs. The KELT survey represents a new generation of surveys that has many epochs over a large portion of the sky. KELT samples over 60% of the sky in both northern and southern hemispheres, and has a long-time-baseline of 4-10 years with a very high cadence rate of less than 20 minutes. This translates into 4,000 to 10,000+ epochs per light curve with completeness out to 3 kpc from the Sun. This poster will present follow-up data taken of RR Lyrae candidate stars found in the KELT survey. These stars were observed using an 11inch telescope at the NKU Schneider Observatory.

By examining the stars within globular clusters, particularly RR Lyrae stars, one can better understand post main sequence evolution of stars and in particular the morphology of the horizontal branch. We present results from observations of the globular cluster NGC 6584 that were gathered using the 0.6 m SARA telescope at CTIO. Nearly 1000 images were obtained in B, V, and I bands from July 2014 through July 2015. This research is a more in depth study of the cluster producing higher quality light curves than those previously done by our group (Toddy et al.) whose main goal was to search for variable stars in NGC6584. Difference image analysis was applied to our images resulting in 77 total variable stars being found in our 13’x13’ field of view. Of these 66 were RR Lyrae stars, with 50 being of type RR0 and 16 of type RR1. This is 3 more than found in our previous study. 14 of the RR0s exhibited the Blazhko Effect. The remainder of the variables were split among 7 long period variables, and 4 eclipsing binaries. The average period of the type RR0 variables was found to be 0.54299 days and for type RR1 variables was 0.30610 days. The periods of the RR Lyrae stars and ratio of <i>N<sub>1</sub></i>/(<i>N<sub>0</sub></i>+<i>N<sub>1</sub></i>) of 0.24 is indicative of an Oosterhoff Type I cluster. Our observations were of high enough quality and phase coverage that we were able to apply Fourier decomposition to the light curves of most of the RR Lyrae stars. By examining the Fourier coefficients of each variable we have determined the absolute magnitude of the variables, the amount of interstellar reddening, the distance to the cluster, the metallicity, as well as other physical parameters of the RR Lyrae stars in NGC 6584.\n",12,

The K2 observations allow us to perform ensemble asteroseismology of a population that is much older than that in the open clusters in the original Kepler field. This should help us answer long-standing questions concerning mass loss on the red giant branch and the spread in masses along the horizontal branch. By combining the asteroseismic data with chemical tagging of sub-populations from spectroscopy, we hope to better constrain stellar evolution models and potentially shed some light on the formation history of GCs. <br /><br />The very crowded nature of stars in GCs poses a challenge, however, due to Kepler’s large pixels.  M4, observed during K2’s campaign 2, presents an excellent opportunity to study GCs with a combination of K2 and ground-based data.  M4 is one of the two nearest GCs and thus should appear less crowded and brighter; in fact M4 is likely the only GC whose horizontal branch stars, other than RR Lyraes, will be accessible with K2.  We discuss our method of obtaining photometry for the stars in M4 and present sample lightcurves for different classes of oscillating stars in the cluster. We also discuss efforts to use ground-based observations to increase the utility of the K2 dataset.\n",13,

V. McSwain*,M. V. McSwain*,Sessioned,Lehigh Univ.,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Classical Be stars are a class of active B-type stars, on or near the main-sequence, that have circumstellar disks that are observed via hydrogen Balmer and other line emission. As a population, Be stars are very fast rotators, nearly at the critical point, and rotation introduces significant distortions to the shape of the star. The slightly sub-critical rotation is not sufficient to move material from the stellar surface into the disk, and it is likely that weaker processes such as nonradial pulsations are also required. Here, we present a model of the flux variations of a rotationally distorted stellar surface, perturbed by nonradial pulsations, for comparison to precision time series photometry. We discuss potential applications of our model, such as estimating the flow of mass and angular momentum into the circumstellar disks of Be stars.<br /><br />We are grateful for support from the National Science Foundation grant AST-1109247.\n",14,

We analyze M33 RR Lyrae variables in 7 different fields located at a range of galactocentric distances in M33. The data were taken using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In order to identify and characterize the variable stars, we use locally written software based on the template light curve fitting technique to determine periods and amplitudes. From the fitted light curves, we can calculate the metallicities and reddenings of the RR Lyrae stars. By combining our results with those from the literature, we are also able to construct the radial density profile of RR Lyraes to investigate whether it is consistent with a halo or disk component\n",15,

We describe a statistical framework for <i>light curve demography—</i>optimal accumulation and extraction of information, not only <i>along</i> individual light curves as conventional methods do, but also <i>across</i> large ensembles of related light curves.  We build the framework using tools from functional data analysis (FDA), a rapidly growing area of statistics that addresses inference from datasets that sample ensembles of related functions.  Our Bayesian FDA framework builds hierarchical models that describe light curve ensembles using multiple levels of randomness:  upper levels describe the source population, and lower levels describe the observation process, including measurement errors and selection effects.  Roughly speaking, a particular object's light curve is modeled as the sum of a parameterized template component (modeling population-averaged behavior) and a peculiar component (modeling variability across the population), subsequently subjected to an observation model.  A functional shrinkage adjustment to individual light curves emerges—an adaptive, functional generalization of the kind of adjustments made for Eddington or Malmquist bias in single-epoch photometric surveys.

These FUV spectral emissions that include NV 1240, OI 1305,C II 1335A, Si IV 1400A, and He II 1640 show peaks prior to the maximum optical brightness (during the “piston” phase of the pulsation that is observed to be in phase with the stellar pulsations, but the observed X-ray emission occurs near minimum light (near 0.4-0.5P) during the maximum radius and coolest phase of the star. Cepheid stars are an integral part of the cosmic distance ladder, due to their Period-Luminosity relationship (the Leavitt Law). Understanding the dynamics of Cepheid stars, especially with respect to FUV and X-ray emissions, is necessary to be confident in assertions derived from the cosmic distance ladder, including establishing the Hubble Constant to more accurate values.<br /><br />Presented here is a possible explanation for the pulsation period-related observed UV and X-ray emissions of these Cepheids. Using stellar interior and atmosphere models, conditions found in the ionization zone and outer atmosphere of these stars may be conducive to shocks being formed that are capable of temperatures great enough to produce x-ray emission. The mechanics of these shocks and their propagation in the atmosphere of the stars can potentially explain both the apparent pulsation-phased peaks for the FUV, as well as the pulsation-phase dependent (currently unexplained) X-ray emissions.<br /><br />This research was supported by NASA Grants: HST grant HST-GO-13019-A, XMM-Newton grant NNX14AAF12G, and<br />Chandra Grant GO-15202X.

Toce*,M. Toce*; E. F. Guinan; S. G. Engle; R. P. Wasatonic,Sessioned,Villanova University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Classical Cepheids are pulsating, yellow supergiants and one of the most important classes of variable stars. They have a direct linear relationship between their period and luminosity and thus serve as crucial “standard candles” for determining the cosmic distance scale and measuring the Hubble Constant. Also, Cepheids play a fundamental role in the calibration of Type Ia supernovae, indicating that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, and also infer the existence of dark energy. Studies of changes in their pulsation periods and amplitudes reveal evolutionary changes too subtle to detect directly, and understanding these various characteristics of Cepheids is critical to their use as high-precision standard candles. To this end, the Villanova Secret Lives of Cepheids (SLiC) program was created as a comprehensive study of Cepheid behavior, evolution, pulsations, atmospheres, heating dynamics, shocks and winds. As part of the SLiC program, ground-based photometry is being carried out of small sample of bright Cepheids. The observations are being made using the 14-inch reflector telescope at Villanova Campus Observatory. Mounted on the telescope is a SBIG photoelectric photometer equipped with standard Johnson UBVRI filters. Photometry is being carried out of the following stars along with their spectral type, period, and visual mag: X Cyg (F7Ib, ~16.39d, 6.47mag), DT Cyg (F7.5Ib, ~2.5d, 5.82mag), S Sge (G5Ibv, ~8.38d, 5.36mag), FF Aql (F6Ib, ~4.47d, 5.38mag), Eta Aql (F6Iab, ~7.18d,3.80mag), and Delta Cep (F5Iab, ~5.37d, 3.75mag). The primary scientific objectives are to obtain light curves to investigate possible evolutionary changes from small variations in luminosity, light amplitude and pulsation period. Special emphasis was placed on the classical Cepheid X Cyg due to recent changes in pulsation period, shown by Szabados via a phase jump in X Cyg’s O-C (observed – calculated). X Cyg holds priority in our observations as we attempt to affirm or deny this pulsation period change.

In order to make this comparison, the periods reported by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) Catalog for Variable Stars in the Kepler Field of View, a study that identified targets for the Kepler Mission before its launch, were compared to periods determined by this study. Only targets that were identified in the ASAS Catalog and later observed by the Kepler Mission were selected for analysis, for a total of 599 targets. The observations gathered by the Kepler Mission were analyzed using three period-finding algorithms: the Lafler-Kinman algorithm, the Analysis of Variance algorithm, and the Conditional Entropy algorithm. These three algorithms analyzed the light curves of each target, and one of the periods produced was selected to be compared to the period found by the ASAS Catalog. The analysis of the two data sets highlights issues with the performance of period finding algorithms with ground-based data, leading to crude period estimates for all targets with periods longer than 10 days. Since the Large Synoptic Scanning Telescope (LSST), due for first light in 2020, will have a similar observation schedule to that of the ASAS survey, similar issues can be expected with the analysis of LSST data for some types of long period variables, like semiregulars), that have periods longer than 10 days.

Recent studies find the dustiest, most extreme AGB stars contribute a disproportionately large amount of matter to their host galaxies; these extreme AGB stars are also the most variable, and they emit most of their energy at mid-infrared wavelengths. Therefore, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have imaged several target AGB stars identified in previous surveys of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Our aim is to obtain light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns wavelength for these extreme AGB stars. Using multiple epochs of data taken within the last 3 years by our survey and then further comparing this data to past surveys of the SMC and LMC with Spitzer, we were able to generate preliminary light curves for a sample of 30 extreme AGB stars, as well as for other stars found within the image fields.

The Medium Deep survey, which consists of 10 fields located uniformly across the sky, totaling 70 square degrees, is observed each night, in 2-3 filters per field, with 8 exposures per filter, resulting in 3000-4000 data points per star over a time span of 3.5 years. To find the variables, we select objects with > 200 detections, and remove those flagged as saturated. No other cuts are used. There are approximately 2.4 million objects that fit this criteria, with magnitudes between 13th and 24th. These objects are then passed through a lomb-scargle fitting routine to determine periodicity. After a periodicity cut, the candidates are classified by eye into different types of variable stars.

RR Lyrae stars found in globular clusters have a variety of uses in probing the physical characteristics of the stellar population itself and its evolution. Building upon our previous study, we focus on the RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster NGC 4833. From March through June 2014, we used the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy 0.6-meter telescope located at CTIO to collect nearly 1,500 images of NGC 4833 in the B, V, R, and I bands. Using difference image analysis we identified 40 variable stars. Of these, 20 were RR Lyrae stars with 10 being of type RR0, 7 of type RR1, and 3 of type RR2. Additionally, 6 SX Phe, 5 eclipsing binaries, and 9 long period variables were identified. The average period of the type RR0, RR1, and RR2 type variables were 0.69597 days, 0.39547 days, and 0.30654 days, respectively. The periods of the RR Lyrae stars and ratio of N<sub>1</sub>/(N<sub>0</sub>+N<sub>1</sub>) of 0.41 is indicative of an Oosterhoff Type II cluster. The observations of the RR Lyrae stars were of very high quality and phase coverage allowing us to perform Fourier decomposition of their light curves. From this Fourier decomposition we were able to determine the physical characteristics of the RR Lyrae stars. We found the mean iron abundance to be [Fe/H]<sub>JKZW</sub> = -1.87 ± 0.06, the mean apparent V-magnitude RR0 and RR1 type variables to be V<sub>RR</sub> = 15.51 ± 0.11, a mean absolute V-magnitude of M<sub>V</sub> = 0.636 ± 0.053; and an effective temperature for RR0’s and RR1’s of log<sub>10</sub>T<sub>eff</sub> = 3.797 and log<sub>10</sub>T<sub>eff</sub> = 3.855, respectively.

The early stages of this process have been observed in the form of interacting galaxy pairs as well dual active galactic nuclei with kilo-parsec separations, but detections of the close, bound binaries that are expected to follow have proven elusive.  With this motivation, we have been conducting a systematic observational search for sub-parsec separation supermassive black hole binaries.  Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the secondary black hole in the system is active and the resulting broad emission lines are doppler shifted due to orbital motion in the binary (analogous to a single-line spectroscopc binary star).

Richards,Sessioned,Drexel University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Using a Bayesian selection algorithm, we determine the optimal combination of color and variability information to identify quasars in current and future multi-epoch optical surveys. The color analysis is based on SDSS photometry, and the variability parameters are calculated from power-law fits to the structure functions. Simultaneous color and variability classification improves classification over either color or variability selection alone, with particular improvement in the selection of quasars with colors similar to stars. This method identifies 22,867 new type 1 quasar candidates in SDSS Stripe 82, which can be combined with the WISE and SDSS photometric quasar candidate catalogs. The redshifts of the candidate quasars were estimated using all available bands, weighting each band by smoothing the PDF. We show how to correct the candidate quasar luminosity function (QLF) for the completeness fraction and systematic errors in redshifts. The corrected QLF is comparable to those determined by spectroscopic investigations, suggesting that LSST and other next-generation surveys will be able to accurately determine the QLF in the absence of spectra. Finally, the quasars are divided into high and low Eddington fractions, using delta(g-i) and CIV blueshift as proxies. The candidate QLFs for the two populations are compared to look for changes as a function of redshift. This work was supported in part by NSF grant 1411773.\n",5,

A. Mason*,P. A. Mason*; P. L. Biermann,Sessioned,New Mexico State University; Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Extreme cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes have a negative effect on life when flux densities are high enough to cause excessive biological, especially DNA, damage. The CR history of a planet plays an important role in its potential surface habitation. Both global and local CR conditions determine the ability of life to survive for astrobiologically relevant time periods. We highlight two CR life-limiting factors: 1) General galactic activity, starburst and AGN, was up by about a factor of 30 at redshift 1 - 2, per comoving frame, averaged over all galaxies. And 2) AGN activity is highly intermittent, so extreme brief but powerful bursts (Her A for example) can be  detrimental at great distances. This means that during such brief bursts of AGN activity the extragalactic CRs might even overpower the local galactic CRs. But as shown by the starburst galaxy M82, the local CRs in a starburst can also be quite high. Moreover, in our cosmic neighborhood we have several super-massive black holes. These are in M31, M32, M81, NGC5128 (Cen A), and in our own Galaxy, all within about 4 Mpc today. Within about 20 Mpc today there are many more super-massive black holes. Cen A is of course the most famous one now, since it may be a major source of the ultra-high-energy CRs (UHECRs). Folding in what redshift means in terms of cosmic time, this implies that there may have been little chance for life to survive much earlier than Earth's starting epoch. We speculate, on whether the very slow start oflife on Earth is connected to the decay of disturbing CR activity.\n",1,

A. Kaib*,N. A. Kaib*; J. E. Chambers,Sessioned,University of Oklahoma; Carnegie Institution for Science,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Many features of the outer solar system are replicated in numerical simulations if the giant planets undergo an orbital instability that ejects one or more ice giants. During this instability, the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are believed to diverge, crossing their 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and this resonance-crossing can excite the orbits of the terrestrial planets. Using a large ensemble of numerical simulations of this giant planet instability, we directly model the evolution of the terrestrial planet orbits during this process, paying special attention to those systems that reproduce the basic features of the outer planets. In systems that retain four giant planets and finish with Jupiter and Saturn beyond their 2:1 MMR, we find at least an 85% probability that at least one terrestrial planet is lost. Moreover, systems that manage to retain all four terrestrial planets often finish with terrestrial planet eccentricities and inclinations larger than the observed ones. There is less than a 5% chance that the terrestrial planet orbits will have a level of excitation comparable to the observed orbits. If we factor in the probability that the outer planetary orbits are well-replicated, we find a probability of 1% or less that the orbital architectures of the inner and outer planets are simultaneously reproduced in the same system. These small probabilities raise the prospect that the giant planet instability may have occurred before the terrestrial planets had formed. Such a scenario implies that the giant planet instability is not the source of the Late Heavy Bombardment and that terrestrial planet formation finished with the giant planets in their post-instability configuration.\n",2,

Thomas*,B. Thomas*; P. Neale,Sessioned,Washburn Univ.; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Astrophysical ionizing radiation events have been recognized as a potential threat to life on Earth for decades.  Although there is some direct biological damage on the surface from redistributed radiation several studies have indicated that the greatest long term threat is from ozone depletion and subsequent heightened solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  It is known that organisms exposed to this irradiation experience harmful effects such as sunburn and even direct damage to DNA, proteins, or other cellular structures. Simulations of the atmospheric effects of a variety of events (such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and solar proton events) have been previously published, along with estimates of biological damage at Earth’s surface.  In the present work, we employed a radiative transfer model to expand and improve calculations of surface-level irradiance and biological impacts following an ionizing radiation event.  We considered changes in surface-level UVB, UVA, and photosynthetically active radiation (visible light). Using biological weighting functions we have considered a wide range of effects, including: erythema and skin cancer in humans; inhibition of photosynthesis in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum </i>sp. and dinoflagellate <i>Prorocentrum micans</i>; inhibition of carbon fixation in Antarctic phytoplankton; inhibition of growth of oat (<i>Avena sativa</i> L. cv. Otana) seedlings; and cataracts. We found that past work overestimated UVB irradiance, but that relative estimates for increase in exposure to DNA damaging radiation are still similar to our improved calculations.  We also found that the intensity of biologically damaging radiation varies widely with organism and specific impact considered; these results have implications for biosphere-level damage following astrophysical ionizing radiation events. When considering changes in surface-level visible light irradiance, we found that, contrary to previous assumptions, a decrease in irradiance is only present for a short time in very limited geographical areas; instead we found a net increase for most of the modeled time-space region.  This result has implications for proposed climate changes associated with ionizing radiation events.\n",3,

Barnes,Sessioned,University of Washington; NAI Virtual Planetary Laboratory; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of California - Santa Cruz,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The spectral detection of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in a planetary atmosphere has been considered a robust signature of life because O<sub>2</sub> is highly reactive on planets with Earth-like redox buffers and because significant continuous abiotic sources were thought to be implausible. However, recent work has revealed the possibility that significant O<sub>2</sub> may build-up in terrestrial atmospheres through (1) photochemical channels or (2) through the escape of hydrogen. We focus on the latter category here. Significant amounts of abiotic O<sub>2 </sub>could remain in the atmospheres of planets in the habitable zones of late type stars, where an early runaway greenhouse and massive hydrogen escape during the pre-main-sequence phase could have irreversibly oxidized the crust and mantle (Luger & Barnes 2015). Additionally, it has been hypothesized that O<sub>2 </sub>could accumulate in the atmospheres of planets with sufficiently low abundances of non-condensable gases such as N<sub>2 </sub>where water would not be cold trapped in the troposphere, leading to H-escape from UV photolysis in a wet stratosphere (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2014). We self-consistently model the climate, photochemistry, and spectra of both rarefied and post-runaway, high-O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres. Because an early runaway might not have lasted long enough for the entire water inventory to escape, we explore both completely desiccated scenarios and cases where a surface ocean remains. We find “habitable” surface conditions for a wide variety of oxygen abundances, atmospheric masses, and CO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratios. If O<sub>2</sub> builds up from massive or sustained H escape, the O<sub>2</sub> abundance should be very high, and could be spectrally indicated by the presence of O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>4</sub>) collisionally-induced absorption (CIA) features. We generate synthetic direct-imaging and transit transmission spectra of these atmospheres and calculate the strength of the UV/Visible and NIR O<sub>4</sub> features. We find that while both the UV/Visible and NIR O<sub>4</sub> features are strong in the radiance spectra of very high-O<sub>2</sub> atmospheres, only the NIR O<sub>4</sub> features are strong in transmission spectra. We also conclude that detection of N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> CIA near 4.2 μm in transmission or direct-imaging spectra could rule out O<sub>2</sub> origination from H-escape from thin atmospheres.\n",4,

JAESE’s first issue was published on December 31, 2014 and has published two volumes and three issues since that time, encompassing 15 peer-reviewed articles. By far, the median article topic has been focused on planetarium education research, while there has only been one article on solid Earth geosciences education research. Although there is not yet an even distribution of topics across the field, there is a relatively even distribution among author demographics. Authors include a range of both junior and senior members of the field. There have been slightly female authors than male authors. Submissions are distributed to two or three reviewers with authors’ names redacted from the manuscript. The average time to complete the first round of peer-review reviewers is 6.2-weeks. There have been too few manuscripts to reliably publish a “percentage acceptance rate.” Finally, the majority of recently completed astronomy education research doctoral dissertations have been published in JAESE. Taken together, JAESE’s guiding Editorial Advisory Board judges this to be a successful first year. In a purposeful effort to make JAESE authors’ scholarly works as widely accessible as possible, JAESE adopted an open-access business model. JAESE articles are available to read free-of-charge over the Internet, delivered as PDFs. To date, the most common way articles are downloaded by readers is through Google Scholar. Instead of charging readers and libraries recurring subscription fees, JAESE charges authors a nominal submission fee and a small open-access fee, averaging about $500 USD. These charges are similar to the traditional page charges typically charged to authors or their institutions by scientific journals, making JAESE an attractive publishing venue for many scholars to make their work as widely read as possible.\n",5,

It is expected that gas will form a circumbinary accretion disk around the SMBH binary that will persistently feed individual “mini-disks” via dense streams out to their tidal truncation radii. However, these radii are not well known during the late stages of inspiral and merger. We present general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations aimed at resolving this uncertainty and producing templates of unique electromagnetic (EM) signatures for such systems to assist in direct observational detection with currently available observatories. We place particular emphasis on the dynamics of the individual “mini-disks” where violent shocks via disk-disk and disk-stream interactions will likely produce intense EM emission.<br />\n",1,

Though applications of the theory are wide-spread and powerful tools for explaining observations, such as Soltan's argument using quasar power, broadened iron line measurements, continuum fitting, and recently reverberation mapping, a significant large-scale magnetic field causes substantial deviations from standard thin disk behavior. We have used fully 3D general relativistic MHD simulations with cooling to explore the thin (H/R~0.1) magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state and quantify these deviations. This work demonstrates that accumulation of large-scale magnetic flux into the MAD state is possible, and then extends prior numerical studies of thicker disks, allowing us to measure how jet power scales with the disk state, providing a natural explanation of phenomena like jet quenching in the high-soft state of X-ray binaries. We have also simulated thin MAD disks with a misaligned black hole spin axis in order to understand further deviations from thin disk theory that may significantly affect observations.\n",2,

Roth*,N. Roth*; D. Kasen; J. Guillochon; E. Ramirez-Ruiz,Sessioned,UC Berkeley; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; UC Santa Cruz,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Given the recent influx of observational data and theoretical investigation into the nature of the tidal disruption of stars by super-massive black holes (TDEs), a full radiative transfer calculation applicable to an optically thick, electron scattering-dominated reprocessing region can provide valuable insight. Such a calculation can help address puzzles such as the lack of hydrogen emission lines in the optical spectra some TDEs, the origin of the optical and UV flux, and the simultaneous observation of x-rays along with the optical emission. In this talk I will discuss such a calculation performed with my collaborators as part of my dissertation. We track the reprocessing of accretion luminosity from a supermassive black hole as the light travels through an extended, spherical envelope composed of hydrogen, helium,<b> </b>and oxygen from the disrupted star. The steady-state radiative transfer equation is coupled to a solver for the atomic level populations and ionization states that does not assume local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our calculations show how the hydrogen optical emission lines can become more effectively optically thick than their helium counterparts, causing them to remain hidden even in the disruption of a hydrogen-rich star. More generally, variations in the structure of the reprocessing material can give rise to a variety of hydrogen-to-helium line ratios, as has been seen in recent observations. We also determine the amount of material necessary to transfer enough radiative energy from x-ray to optical wavelengths to match what is observed, and we demonstrate how the partial absorption of ionizing radiation can give rise to events simultaneously observed in x-rays and in the optical.\n",4,

Coughlin*,Sessioned,"Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences, University of Colorado; JILA, University of Colorado and National Institute of Standards and Technology","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): When a star comes within a critical distance of a supermassive black hole, the tidal force exerted by the hole overcomes the stellar self-gravity. The star is subsequently torn apart, creating a stream of tidally-shredded debris that initially recedes from the hole, eventually returns to pericenter, forms an accretion disk and generates a highly luminous event that can sometimes be accompanied by the production of relativistic jets. This entire process is known as a tidal disruption event (TDE), and dozens of these events have already been observed. I will discuss my most recent work that has analyzed the tidal disruption process, and in particular I will focus on the results of numerical and analytical investigations that show that the streams of debris produced during TDEs can be gravitationally unstable. Specifically, I will describe how compressive motions augment the importance of self-gravity not long after the star is disrupted, resulting in the fragmentation of the debris stream into small-scale clumps. These findings will be discussed in the context of the observational signatures of tidal disruption events, and I will also relate these results to my past investigations concerning accretion disk formation and jet launching during TDEs.\n",5,

Vikhlinin,Sessioned,SAO; MPA; IKI; University of Wisconsin; Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): M87, the bright active galaxy dominating the core of the Virgo cluster, is ideal for studying the interaction of a supermassive black hole with a gas rich environment. We combine results from a deep Chandra observation with a simple shock model to derive the properties of the outburst that created the 13 kpc shock previously reported around M87. The principal constraints for the model are 1) the observed temperature and density profiles, 2) the measured Mach number (about 1.2) and radius of the 13 kpc shock, 3) the observed size of the inner cavity (~3 kpc) that serves as the piston to drive the shock, and 4) the absence of a hot, low density plasma surrounding the central cavity. Qualitatively, the absence of a hot, low density (shocked) region surrounding the inner radio lobes (the piston), requires a ""slowly"" expanding piston and ""long"" duration outburst rather than a Sedov-like outburst. Quantitatively, a roughly 5 x 10<sup>57 </sup>ergs outburst that began about 12 Myr ago and lasted about 2 Myr matches all the constraints. In the context of the model, ~20% of the energy is carried by the shock as it expands to large radii while ~80% of the outburst energy is available to heat the core gas. For an outburst repetition rate of about 12 Myrs (the outburst age), 80% of the outburst energy is sufficient to balance radiative cooling. We discuss the outburst history of M87 as chronicled in its radio and X-ray images and the implications of these outbursts for heating gas rich environments.\n",1,

Recent works show that elliptical galaxies can rapidly transition from blue star forming to red quiescent systems. Such rapid reddening of stellar populations implies that gas reservoirs are being depleted on timescales which are much shorter than mere exhaustion thanks to ongoing star formation. Feedback, either from star formation itself or from nuclear activity associated with black hole growth is typically invoked. Yet observational confirmation has remained elusive.<br /><br />Using the 10.4-m CSO, we recently obtained 12CO(2-1) observations for a sample of blue star forming local elliptical galaxies to probe the state of the gas and look at the changes in excitation temperature across the star forming sequence. Previous IRAM 12CO(1-0) measurements indicate this population is undergoing a sudden decline in molecular gas fraction. This drop occurs ~200 Myr after a recent peak in star formation- a timescale suggesting AGN triggered feedback switches on rapidly and is immediately effective. The jets or outflows from the central supermassive black hole likely either heat or expel residual gas cutting off star formation, but the 12CO(1-0) measurements alone were insufficient to distinguish between these two scenarios. The 12CO(2-1) to 12CO(1-0) ratio has previously proved diagnostic of the conditions which exist in star forming galaxies. Combining the new 12CO(2-1) measurements with the previous 12CO(1-0) data, we find evidence for active quenching of star formation due to the expulsion of the gas reservoir by the central massive black holes residing in these galaxies. We will discuss our observations and analysis and compare our results to those from other early type populations.\n",3,

In order to investigate this more directly, we have initiated spectroscopic survey for the early-type host galaxies, for which population age and metallicity can be more reliably determined from the Lick absorption-line indices. In this talk, we present the results from high signal-to-noise ratio (> 100) spectra for 27 nearby host galaxies observed in Las Campanas Observatory. For the first time, we find a significant correlation between host galaxy mass (velocity dispersion) and population age, which is consistent with the ""downsizing"" trend among non-host early-type galaxies. Since we find no correlation with metallicity, our result suggests that stellar population age is mainly responsible for the relation between host mass and Hubble residual. If confirmed, this would imply that the luminosity evolution plays a major role in the systematic uncertainties of SN Ia cosmology.\n",4,

The observed optical/near-IR spectra of massive ellipticals show evidence for an excess of low-mass stars (based on gravity sensitive absorption lines like Na and FeH) over that expected from a standard Milky Way-like IMF, which is observed in low-mass ellipticals. This suggests that massive ellipticals have a “bottom heavy” IMF with substantially steeper slopes than standard IMFs. An extrapolation of such a steep-slope IMF to high stellar masses would lead to a deficit of black hole and neutron star formation compared to a standard IMF; correspondingly, fewer low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) per unit stellar mass would be expected for the steep-slope IMF. Using new Chandra observations of six low-mass ellipticals plus seven previously observed high-mass ellipticals, we test whether the number of LMXBs per unit K-band luminosity (N/LK) is consistent with a changing IMF with galaxy mass. We find nearly constant values of N/LK over the full mass range, implying there is very little change in the high stellar-mass (>8 Msol) end of the IMF for these galaxies despite the optical/near-IR evidence for changes in the low stellar-mass end of the IMF. We will discuss implications for how the overall IMF shape of elliptical galaxies changes as a function of galaxy mass.\n",7,

Dalcanton,Sessioned,University of Washington,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Tracking star formation rates within galaxies is essential to understanding not only how efficiently gas transforms into stars, but also how entire galaxies evolve. In the nearby Universe, observations of resolved stellar populations enable the measurement of star formation rates as a function of position and time — spatially-resolved star formation histories (SFHs) — within a single galaxy. Combined with multi-wavelength observations of dust and gas, these resolved SFHs represent the most direct way to holistically probe galaxy evolution. Leveraging observations from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program, I have measured the spatially-resolved SFH of M31’s disk at a resolution of 0.1 kpc over the past 500 Myr. This resolved SFH has provided new insights into a broad range of astrophysical processes from the dynamical longevity of M31’s star-forming rings to the connection between star formation and M31’s gas and dust contents. In addition to analyzing the star formation efficiency in M31, I have examined spatial and temporal correlations between star formation and the interstellar medium to investigate the star formation cycle on physical scales of order the size of star-forming regions. I have used the resolved SFHs derived with <i>optical</i> data to predict the spatially-resolved <i>ultraviolet</i> flux of M31 to an accuracy of >95%. The small differences may indicate the UV contribution of ancient stellar populations. Data products from my work are being used to empirically constrain stellar feedback, which will inform future treatment of such feedback in galaxy simulations. These studies together reveal the most finely spatially-resolved view of star formation in an L_star galaxy to date.\n",8,

BART is written in Python and C. Python modules generate atmospheric profiles from sets of MCMC parameters and integrate the resulting spectra over observational bandpasses, allowing high flexibility in modeling the planet without interacting with the fast, C portions that calculate the spectra. BART's shared memory and optimized opacity calculation allow it to run on a laptop, enabling classroom use. Runs can scale constant abundance profiles, profiles of thermochemical equilibrium abundances (TEA) calculated by the included TEA code, or arbitrary curves. Several thermal profile parameterizations are available. BART is an open-source, reproducible-research code.

Riggs*,A. Riggs*; N. J. Kasdin; T. D. Groff,Sessioned,Princeton University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): To image the reflected light from exoplanets and disks, an instrument must suppress diffracted starlight by about nine orders of magnitude. A coronagraph alters the stellar PSF to create regions of high contrast, but it is extremely sensitive to wavefront aberrations. Deformable mirrors (DMs) are necessary to mitigate these quasi-static aberrations and recover high-contrast. To avoid non-common path aberrations, the science camera must be used as the primary wavefront sensor. Focal plane wavefront correction is an iterative process, and obtaining sufficient signal in the dark holes requires long exposure times. The fastest coronagraphic wavefront correction techniques require estimates of the stellar electric field. The main challenge of coronagraphy is thus to perform complex wavefront estimation quickly and efficiently using intensity images from the camera. The most widely applicable and tested technique is DM Diversity, in which a DM modulates the focal plane intensity and several images are used to reconstruct the stellar electric field in a batch process. At the High Contrast Imaging Lab (HCIL) at Princeton, we have developed an iterative extended Kalman filter (IEKF) to improve upon this technique. The IEKF enables recursive starlight estimation and can utilize fewer images per iteration, thereby speeding up wavefront correction. This IEKF formulation also estimates the bias in the images recursively. Since exoplanets and disks are embedded in the incoherent bias signal, the IEKF enables detection of science targets during wavefront correction. Here we present simulated and experimental results from Princeton's HCIL demonstrating the effectiveness of the IEKF for recursive electric field estimation and exoplanet detection.\n",4,

Thomas,Sessioned,NASA Ames Research Center; LSST,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Several starlight suppression systems have been demonstrated in the lab that can remove the leakage of light from a star down to almost 1e10 contrast, but only for single-star systems. Despite the ubiquity and importance of multi-star systems, they are typically excluded from mission target lists and multi-star imaging technology has not been strongly pursued.<br /><br />We show preliminary laboratory results advancing the technology readiness of a method to directly image planets and disks in <i>multi-star</i> systems such as Alpha Centauri. This method works with almost any coronagraph (or external occulter with a DM) and requires little or no change to existing and mature hardware. Because of the ubiquity of multi-star systems, this method potentially multiplies the science yield of many missions and concepts such as AFTA, Exo-C, Exo-S, EXCEDE, and potentially enables the detection of Earth-like planets (if they exist) around our nearest-neighbor star, Alpha Centauri, with a small and cheap space telescope such as ACESat or Centaur+.<br /><br />We identified two main challenges associated with double-star (or multi-star) systems and methods to solve them. The first challenge is that multi-star separation is typically beyond the outer working angle (spatial Nyquist frequency) of the deformable mirror. To address this, we are developing “Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control” where a mild grating or the DM itself effectively diffracts low-spatial frequency modes of the DM into higher frequencies.<br /><br />The second challenge is to separate and independently remove overlapping speckles from multiple stars. We solve this challenge by a new method we call “Multi-Star Wavefront Control”, which involves partitioning the correction zone and DM modes in a way that completely decouples the wavefront control of the two stars and enables simultaneously solving for both.<br /><br />We present our first lab results and model validation of Super-Nyquist Wavefront Control, where we demonstrate a dark zone beyond the spatial Nyquist limit of a 32x32 DM (i.e. beyond 16 l/D). The demonstration is carried out at the Ames Coroangraph Experiment (ACE) testbed at NASA ARC in monochromatic as well as broadband light.\n",5,

Jimenez-Teja*,Y. Jimenez-Teja*; R. A. Dupke,Sessioned,National Observatory; University of Michigan/Eureka Scientific,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The intracluster light (ICL) is important for understanding the metal enrichment of the intracluster gas and constraining cosmological parameters independently of the other methods. However, its measurement it is not trivial due to the necessity of disentangling the light of stars locked up in galaxies from the proper ICL. Currently, there is no standard method to efficiently measure the ICL (Rudick et al. 2011, ApJ, 732, 48), and different approaches relying on the binding energy of the cluster galaxies, the density of the material, or the surface brightness distribution, have been tried. Moreover, a suitable way to disentangle the limits of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL still has not been developed.The CHEFs (from Chebyshev-Fourier bases, Jiménez-Teja & Benítez 2012, ApJ, 745, 150) are a mathematical tool especially designed to model the two-dimensional light distribution of galaxies. We use the CHEFs and tools from differential geometry to infer the light contribution of the ICL to the total brightness, without imposing any artificial thresholds and avoiding the ambiguity introduced by free parameters that are usually set in these studies (Rudick et al. 2011).We use the extremely deep optical images from Abell 2744, the Pandora cluster, a multi-cluster merger, observed by the Hubble Frontier Fields project to show the efficiency of this new method. The CHEFs can accurately fit and remove all the galaxies close to the cluster center, including the BCG. The limits of the BCG are marked out by determining the points where the surface curvature changes, thus disentangling the ICL from the BCG light in a completely natural way. Once we have the residual image just containing ICL and background, we extrapolate the value of this latter from images of individual pointings close to the main Pandora field. We finally estimate the ICL to be ~24% of the total light, which is very consistent with the predictions from numerical simulations (Montes & Trujillo 2014, ApJ, 794, 137). We emphasize we obtain this result without relying on any assumption on neither the morphology nor the surface distribution of the ICL.\n",1,

The complementary Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) selects galaxy clusters on their stellar mass by identifying overdensities in the Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WISE) All-Sky Data release, which provides a selection independent to that of the SPT. We have followed up the most promising cluster candidates identified from MaDCoWS with Spitzer and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) to get rest-frame H-band luminosities and radio observations of the SZ effect, respectively.

Noble*,A. Noble*,Sessioned,University of Toronto,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Understanding the influence of environment is a fundamental goal in studies of galaxy formation and evolution, and galaxy clusters offer ideal laboratories with which to examine environmental effects on their constituent members. Clusters continually evolve and build up mass through the accumulation of galaxies and groups, resulting in distinct galaxy populations based on their accretion history. In Noble et al. 2013, we presented a novel definition for environment using the phase space of line-of-sight velocity and clustercentric radius, which probes the time-averaged density to which a galaxy has been exposed and traces out accretion histories. Using this dynamical definition of environment reveals a decline in specific star formation towards the cluster core in the earliest accreted galaxies, and was further shown to isolate post-starburst galaxies within clusters (Muzzin et al. 2014). We have now extended this work to higher-redshift clusters at z=1.2 using deep Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE data. With a sample of 120 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members, we investigate various galaxy properties as a function of phase-space environment. Specifically, we use 5-band Herschel photometry to estimate the dust temperature and star formation rate for dynamically distinct galaxy populations, namely recent infalls and those that were accreted into the cluster at an earlier epoch (Noble et al. submitted).  These properties are then compared to a field sample of star-forming galaxies at 1.1 < z < 1.2 to shed light on cluster-specific processes in galaxy evolution.  In this talk I will discuss the various implications of a phase-space definition for environment, and present our most recent results, focusing on how this accretion-based definition aids our understanding of quenching mechanisms within z=1.2 galaxies.\n",6,

Tremblay*,G. Tremblay*,Sessioned,Yale University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): A new ALMA observation of the cool core brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 2597 reveals that a supermassive black hole can act much like a mechanical pump in a water fountain, driving a convective flow of molecular gas that drains into the black hole accretion reservoir, only to be pushed outward again in a jet-driven outflow that then rains back toward the galaxy center from which it came. The ALMA data reveal ""shadows"" cast by giant molecular clouds falling on ballistic trajectories towards the black hole in the innermost 500 parsecs of the galaxy, manifesting as deep redshifted continuum absorption features. The black hole accretion reservoir, fueled by these infalling cold clouds, powers an AGN that drives a jet-driven molecular outflow in the form of a 10 kpc-scale, billion solar mass expanding molecular bubble or plume. The molecular shell is permeated with young stars, perhaps triggered in situ by the jet. Buoyant X-ray cavities excavated by the propagating radio source may further uplift the molecular filaments, which are observed to fall inward toward the center of the galaxy from which they came, presumably keeping the fountain long-lived. The results show that cold molecular gas can couple to black hole growth via both feedback and feeding, in alignment with ""cold chaotic accretion"" models for the regulation of star formation in galaxies.\n",7,

There is substantial evidence that these radio relics trace particles accelerated at cluster merger shocks. However, cluster merger shocks typically have a low Mach number and it is therefore still unclear how these shocks are able to accelerate particles so efficiently, as inferred by the luminosity of these radio relics. A proposed solution to resolve this apparent discrepancy is that cluster shocks re-accelerate a population of fossil relativistic electrons. A likely source for this fossil plasma could be the disturbed tailed radio galaxies that are commonly found in merging galaxy clusters.<br />We present new GMRT and JVLA radio observations of the binary merging galaxy cluster A3411-3412. Combining these observations with deep Chandra data, we find evidence for a surface brightness discontinuity that likely traces a low-Mach number shock. At this location, we observe the presence of a radio relic. Most interestingly, this relic seems to be connected to a nearby radio galaxy. This suggests that electrons from the lobes of this AGN are re-accelerated by a low-Mach number merger shock.

L. Robinson*,E. L. Robinson*,Sessioned,Univ. of Texas,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The likelihood function is a necessary component of Bayesian statistics but not of frequentist statistics.  The likelihood function can, however, serve as the foundation for an attractive variant of frequentist statistics sometimes called likelihood statistics.   We will first discuss the definition and meaning of the likelihood function, giving some examples of its use and abuse - most notably in the so-called prosecutor’s fallacy.   Maximum likelihood estimation is the aspect of likelihood statistics familiar to most people.   When data points are known to have Gaussian probability distributions, maximum likelihood parameter estimation leads directly to least-squares estimation.  When the data points have non-Gaussian distributions, least-squares estimation is no longer appropriate.  We will show how the maximum likelihood principle leads to logical alternatives to least squares estimation for non-Gaussian distributions, taking the Poisson distribution as an example.<br /><br />The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods of, for example, two hypotheses or two parameters.  Likelihood ratios can be treated much like un-normalized probability distributions, greatly extending the applicability and utility of likelihood statistics.  Likelihood ratios are prone to the same complexities that afflict posterior probability distributions in Bayesian statistics.  We will show how meaningful information can be extracted from likelihood ratios by the Laplace approximation, by marginalizing, or by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.\n",1,

The other half are millisecond pulsars, many of which were found in the radio by looking at Fermi unassociated sources, and nearly all of which show radio pulsations. The wide variety of gamma-ray pulse shapes, their well-determined and often pulse-phase-resolved spectra, and comparisons with radio pulses when available, have taught us much about the elusive pulsar emission mechanisms.

In order to test these predictions directly, masses of individual stars must be measured and combined with broadband photometry and medium-resolution spectroscopy to probe stellar atmospheres. I will present results from an astrometric and spectroscopic survey of low-mass pre-main sequence binary stars to measure individual dynamical masses and compare to model predictions. This is the first systematic test of a large number of stellar systems of intermediate age between young star-forming regions and old field stars. Stars in our sample are members of the Tuc-Hor, AB Doradus, and beta Pictoris moving groups, the last of which includes GJ 3305 AB, the wide binary companion to the imaged exoplanet host 51 Eri. I will also present results of Spitzer observations of secondary eclipses of LHS 6343 C, a T dwarf transiting one member of an M+M binary in the Kepler field. By combining these data with Kepler photometry and radial velocity observations, we can measure the luminosity, mass, and radius of the brown dwarf. This is the first non-inflated brown dwarf for which all three of these parameters have been measured, providing the first benchmark to test model predictions of the masses and radii of field T dwarfs.

Godfrey,Sessioned,CUNY Graduate Center; College of Staten Island; American Museum of Natural History; Hunter College; Carnegie Institution of Washington,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The physical and atmospheric properties of ultracool dwarfs are deeply entangled due to the degenerate effects of mass, age, metallicity, clouds and dust, activity, rotation, and possibly even formation mechanism on observed spectra. Accurate determination of fundamental parameters for a wide diversity of objects at the low end of the IMF is thus crucial to testing stellar and planetary formation theories. To determine these quantities, we constructed and flux calibrated nearly-complete spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 221 M, L, T, and Y dwarfs using published parallaxes and 0.3-40 μm spectra and photometry. From these homogeneous SEDs, we calculated bolometric luminosity (L<sub>bol</sub>), effective temperature (T<sub>eff</sub>), mass, surface gravity, radius, spectral indexes, synthetic photometry, and bolometric corrections (BCs) for each object. We used these results to derive L<sub>bol</sub>, T<sub>eff</sub>, and BC polynomial relations across the entire very-low-mass star/brown dwarf/planetary mass regime. We use a subsample of objects with age constraints based on nearby young moving group membership, companionship with a young star, or spectral signatures of low surface gravity to define new age-sensitive diagnostics and characterize the reddening of young substellar atmospheres as a redistribution of flux from the near-infrared into the mid-infrared. Consequently we find the SED flux pivots at Ks band, making BC<sub>Ks</sub> as a function of spectral type a tight and age independent relationship. We find that young L dwarfs are systematically 300 K cooler than field age objects of the same spectral type and up to 600 K cooler than field age objects of the same absolute H magnitude. Finally, we present preliminary comparisons of these empirical results to best fit parameters from four different model atmosphere grids via Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis in order to create prescriptions for the reliable and efficient characterization of new ultracool dwarfs.\n",2,

As the spectrum ages, the cobalt features fade as is expected from the decay of <sup>56</sup>Co to <sup>56</sup>Fe. The strong 1.64 μm [Fe II] feature is sensitive to the central density of the white dwarf just prior to the thermonuclear runaway of C in the core because of electron capture in the early stages of burning, which increases as a function of density. The line profile is dependent on the extent of mixing during any deflagration burning in addition to asymmetries in the distribution of burning products or an off-center ignition. Normalization of a time-series of spectra to the 1.64 μm line allows separation of features produced by stable versus unstable isotopes of iron group elements. Evolution of the width of this feature probes the strength and morphology of magnetic fields in the expanding ejecta. Results of this technique are shown for SN 2005df, with observations spanning 200-400 days past the explosion.

Fisher*,R. Fisher*,Sessioned,University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent observational and theoretical progress has favored merging and helium-accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs) in the double-degenerate and the double-detonation channels, respectively, as the dominant progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Thus the fate of rapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass WDs in the single-degenerate channel remains more mysterious then ever. In this talk, I will clarify the nature of ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia and demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events within Chandrasekhar-mass WDs in the single-degenerate channel are generally expected to be buoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. I will show, using both analytic criteria and multidimensional numerical simulations, that the single-degenerate channel is inherently stochastic and leads to a variety of outcomes from failed SN 2002cx-like events through overluminous SN 1991T-like events. I will also demonstrate how the rates predicted from both the population of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) and binary population synthesis models of the single-degenerate channel can be brought into agreement with single-degenerate SNe Ia. I will further demonstrate that the single-degenerate channel contribution to the normal and failed 2002cx-like rates is not likely to exceed 1% of the total SNe Ia rate. I will conclude with a range of observational tests which will either support or strongly constrain the single-degenerate scenario.\n",6,

The sub-parsec scales in which star formation takes place makes it difficult to resolve the effects star formation and the surrounding dense gas have on each other. The Magellanic Clouds are more active in forming high mass stars as compared to the Milky Way. The SAGE and Heritage surveys combined with the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project provide us the opportunity to study high-mass (>15 solar masses) and low-mass (<1 solar mass) star formation. ALMA observations cover a 60 pc x 30 pc region of CO gas slightly north of the R136 cluster in 30 Doradus. We find 16 young stellar objects and about a 100 pre-main-sequence stars within the ALMA footprint. We define young stellar objects to be very early stage stars that are about 10,000 years old and whose SEDs peak in the infrared, and we use pre-main-sequence-stars to refer to slightly older stars that can be seen in the optical. I will use dendrograms to analyze both the high- and low-mass star properties with respect to the CO gas structure observed with ALMA. Preliminary results show that not all massive young stellar objects are associated with CO gas, higher mass clumps tend to form higher mass stars and are more likely to have multiple young stars, and lower mass clumps tend to not be gravitationally bound however the larger clouds are bound. Looking at the interplay between dense molecular gas and the newly forming stars in a stellar nursery will shed light on how these stars formed: monolithic collapse or competitive accretion.\n",1,

The vast majority of these systems consist of objects on the main sequence or the giant branch, leading to a dearth of knowledge of properties at early times (<50 Myr). Only a dozen binaries and 1 possible transiting Hot Jupiter are known among pre-main sequence objects, yet these are the systems that can provide the best constraints on stellar formation and planetary migration models. The deficiency in the number of well characterized systems is driven by the inherent and aperiodic variability found in pre-main sequence objects which can mask and mimic eclipse signals. Nevertheless a dramatic increase in the total number of systems at early times is required to alleviate the conflict between theory and observation. I have recently completed a photometric survey of 3 nearby (<150 pc) and young (<50 Myr) moving groups with a small aperture telescope. I have discovered over 300 likely pre-main sequence binaries and have ruled out 7 possible transiting Hot Jupiters using techniques developed by reducing crowded, defocused images from an analogous system. I will present the photometric detection and follow-up for these systems, the spectroscopic measurements of pre-main sequence binary candidates and my lower bound on the Hot Jupiter migration timescale.\n",2,

However, there have not been sufficient numbers of young protostars observed with high enough resolution to determine when and where most multiple systems form. To significantly improve our knowledge of protostellar multiplicity, we have carried out the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey, a 264 hour Jansky VLA program at wavelengths of 8 mm, 1 cm, 4 cm, and 6 cm toward all known Perseus protostars (N ~ 80) down to 15 AU (0.065"") resolution. The unbiased nature of the survey has enabled us to conduct the most complete characterization of protostellar multiplicity to date, finding evidence for a bi-modal distribution of multiple protostar system separations. The bi-modal distribution may be evidence for multiple processes contributing to the formation of multiple systems. The inner peak at ~75 AU could be produced from disk fragmentation, while the outer peak at ~3000 AU could be produced by turbulent and/or rotational fragmentation Moreover, three systems are found to reside within larger, disk-like structures suggesting that they may be the product of disk fragmentation via gravitational instability. The results of this survey demonstrate the power and utility of unbiased surveys toward young stars.\n",3,

Somers*,G. Somers*,Sessioned,The Ohio State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Starspots are ubiquitously found on young, active stars on the pre-main sequence (pre-MS), and may cover up to ~50% of their surfaces, but their effects on early stellar evolution have never been fully explored. I study the impact of such extreme spot coverage on pre-MS stellar evolution by modifying an existing stellar evolution code to account for spot effects on both the surface boundary conditions and the transport of energy in the interior. I show that heavy spot coverage systematically increases the radii of young stars, while reducing their luminosity and average surface temperature. Such increased radii may underlie the well-known radius inflation of some young, active stars, while the decreased luminosity and effective temperature displace stars on the HR diagram, leading to systematic under-estimation of stellar masses by up to 2x, and of stellar ages by up to 10x, if spotted stars are interpreted with un-spotted isochrones. The inhomogeneous surfaces of spotted stars also distort the emission spectrum, and can thus explain the anomalous colors of the rapidly rotating K dwarfs of the Pleiades, a young open cluster. I further find that spots reduce the central temperature of stars, leading to a suppression of lithium burning during the pre-MS. As a result, pre-MS stars of equal mass but differing spot properties reach the zero-age main sequence with different surface lithium abundances. I show that this effect can account for the previously unexplained lithium abundance dispersions observed at fixed Teff in the Pleiades, and other young clusters.<br /><br />Synthesizing these results, I argue that the inclusion of spots, a prominent phenomenon on the pre-MS, can explain several outstanding mysteries associated with young stars: inflated radii, age spreads in young clusters, the anomalous colors of rapid rotators, and the lithium abundance dispersions in young star clusters. I discuss implications of under-estimated masses and ages for measuring age spreads in young clusters, studying the initial mass function, measuring planet formation timescales, and inferring the lifetimes of circum-stellar disks.\n",5,

Jang-Condell*,H. Jang-Condell*,Sessioned,University of Wyoming,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): A popular method for obtaining high-contrast images of gas-rich optically thick protoplanetary disks around young stars is polarimetric imaging.  The rationale for this is that light scattered off the disk surface is preferentially polarized, while light emitted directly from the star is not.  Polarimetric imaging has resulted in images of disk surfaces that show morphological complexity, such as gaps, spiral arms, and dark spots.  However, these images need to be interpreted with care, because as the angle of scattering varies across the surface of an inclined disk, so does the polarization fraction vary.  We present simulated images of disks in scattered polarized light, showing that a relatively simple structure, such as an axisymmetric gap, can give the appearance of more complex asymmetric structure when the disk is inclined.  This demonstrates that polarimetric imaging must be interpreted with great caution.  <br />\n",6,

In principle, a region emitting via synchrotron radiation will preferentially cool higher energy electrons leading to a steeper, more strongly curved spectrum in older regions of plasma. Models of this so-called spectral aging have become a commonly used tool when describing the processes involved in emission from the lobes of FR-II radio galaxies; however, the lack of high resolution, broad-bandwidth observations has historically meant the details of these spectra have remained largely unexplored on small spatial scales. The broad-bandwidth capabilities of telescopes such as the JVLA, LOFAR, e-MERLIN and ultimately the SKA, will mean that the spectrum of any given source can be determined within the bandwidth of any given observation, producing a detailed spectral shape. This type of detailed spectral analysis is therefore set to become standard practice when dealing with any new broadband radio observations.<br /><br />In this talk, we provide details of the Broadband Radio Astronomy ToolS (BRATS) software package that uses innovative techniques to analyze this new generation of radio data. Through the application of BRATS to LOFAR and JVLA observations, we present results from our latest investigations into the dynamics and energetics of nearby FR-II radio galaxies and their spectral structure on small spatial scales. We go on to discuss how these new findings impact upon our current understanding of the underlying physics of FR-II radio galaxies and, ultimately, their impact of galaxy evolution as a whole.<br />\n",1,

We use both non-parametric (e.g. line width and asymmetry) and multi-Gaussian fitting to decompose the complex emission profiles close to the AGN. We find line widths containing 80% flux in the range 400 − 1600 km/s with a mean of 790 ± 90 km/s, such high velocities are strongly suggestive that these AGN are driving ionized outflows. Additionally, multi-Gaussian fitting reveals that 14/17 of our targets require 3 separate kinematic components in the ionized gas in their central regions. The broadest components of these fits have FWHM = 530 − 2520 km/s, with a mean value of 920 ± 50 km/s.

Such a correlation is the natural consequence of a contribution to the ionization from shock excitation and we argue that this demonstrates that the outflows from these AGN are directly impacting the surrounding ISM within the galaxies. In addition, we use stellar absorption features to measure kinematics for these AGN host galaxies and those of a control sample selected from the SAMI Galaxy Survey to search for evidence of these luminous AGN being preferentially hosted by disturbed or merging systems.\n",2,

Since SMBHs spend most of their lifetimes in these low accretion-rate states, understanding LINERs is important for understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the context of galaxy evolution. On scales of ~100 pc, the energy budget of LINERs appears to be deficient when the only source of power considered is the AGN. Thus, other energy sources are likely to contribute to the excitation of the emission-line gas. To probe these sources, we observed three nearby, bright, and representative LINERs with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We specifically looked at the 0.1-1 arcsecond scale (corresponding to ~5-50 pc) to find what these energy sources are and how far from the nucleus they take over the excitation of the gas. After subtracting both the unresolved nuclear light and the spatially-extended starlight, we measured a number of diagnostic emission line ratios. We find that within 10 pc, the observed line ratios of [O III]/[O II] vs [O IIII]/H-beta are consistent with AGN photoionization. The line ratios of [N II]/H-alpha vs [O III]/H-beta show that at larger distances, the excitation mechanism is most likely consistent with hot stars or shocks. Shocks are particularly appealing in the case of NGC 4278, which harbors a Gigahetz-Peaked radio source with small jets detected by the VLBA. If hot stars are the primary excitation mechanism, these are most likely post-AGB stars (from the old stellar population). We conclude from these representative cases that the characteristic LINER emission-line spectrum does not result from a single excitation mechanism, but rather from a combination of different mechanisms within the central 100 pc of each object that varies from object to object.\n",3,

We are looking for the variability of different knots and changes in their spectra using our deep, high resolution observations of the jet between 2002 and 2008. The observations have 2-3 times better resolution that any similar previous study (Perlman et al. 1999) in addition allowing us to observe variability.

The knot HST-1, located closest to the nucleus, displayed a huge flare, increasing about 100 times in brightness. The knot A and B complex shows variations in polarization structures indicating the presence of a helical magnetic field which may be responsible for the in-situ particle accelerations in the jet. We compare the evolution of different knots and components of the jet, when our observations overlap with the multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns conducted with <i>HST</i> and <i>Chandra</i> and comment on particle acceleration and main emission processes.

Its kilo-parsec scale jet observed by VLBA(Kollgaard et al. 1990) and parsec scale jet observed by VLBA(Kellermann et al. 1998) are misaligned. This might indicate episodic-jet activity which recently turned on.<br /> This object currently shows two stationary compact parsec-scale components:a bright jet component on the east and less luminous core on the west. Also, it is known that there have been superluminal jet components which are flowing from the core toward east, and then merging with the bright jet component (Marscher et al. 1991, Alberdi et al. 2000, Lister et al. 2013). Including the detection of broad emission lines(SDSS), its viewing angle was concluded to be small. However, the jet component being more luminous than the core is abnormal for a source with a small viewing angle. Furthermore, it has young radio galaxy-like properties such as non-variation in total flux(Alberdi et al. 1997, 2000, MOJAVE database) and a high frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution(Orienti et al 2007). In this case, it is more reliable to think that viewing angle of 4C39.25 is large.<br /> Korean VLBI Network (KVN) and VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy (VERA) Array (KaVA) is a cooperated VLBI system of Korea and Japan which provides high-frequency (23GHz and 43GHz) and high spatial resolution(1.2mas and 0.6mas). Their advantages of multi-wavelength and relatively high S/N ratio relative to its number of baseline allow us to discover the central region and dim structures of 4C39.25. We present results of several epochs observed during 2013 to 2014, focusing on morphological changes of 4C39.25 using KaVA images. According to these results, we were able to find a recently emitted counter-jet component for images of first 6 epochs. Also the counter-jet component propagates along a curved trajectory, and it shows an extreme superluminal motion. This might indicate a necessity of relatively large viewing angle or a helical motion of jet flow.\n",5,

Wyithe,Sessioned,Caltech; University of Melbourne,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Mergers of massive galaxies are thought to host binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which are driven to coalesce by their gravitational-wave (GW) emission. The ubiquity of galaxy mergers through cosmic time then implies the existence of a GW background (GWB) from binary SMBHs. For the last decade, collaborations worldwide have been searching for signatures of GWs in millisecond radio pulsar timing data. This dissertation work is focussed on predicting the nature of the GWB, and on constraining GWB models with pulsar timing data from the Parkes telescope. We find that current estimates of galaxy stellar mass functions, merger rates, and SMBH masses, coupled with the assumption of GW-driven binary SMBH coalescence in each galaxy merger, result in a power-law GWB strain spectrum with amplitude 5.1×10<sup>-16</sup> < A<sub>yr</sub> < 2.4×10<sup>-15</sup> at (1 year)<sup>-1</sup> (95% confidence). This prediction is however in tension with recent 11-year Parkes data on four millisecond pulsars, which imply an upper limit on the GWB amplitude of A<sub>yr</sub> < 1×10<sup>-15</sup> (95% confidence). Indeed, all current predictions for the GWB that include the assumption of universal GW-driven binary SMBH coalescence are excluded with between 91% and 99.7% probability. This startling result challenges the assumptions underlying these predictions. Based on modeling of the growth and demographics of SMBHs, and for the evolution of binary SMBHs in galaxy merger remnants, we consider a series of possible implications of our result, and how they may be tested. It is possible that galaxy merger rates are overestimated, or that the formation of milliparsec-separation binary SMBHs is not ubiquitous in mergers. Alternatively, while emitting detectable GWs, binary SMBHs may also lose energy and angular momentum to their environments, hence attenuating the GWB. Other, intriguing, possibilities are a non-unity SMBH occupation fraction in massive galaxies beyond the local Universe due to rare seed formation, or that the GW ""background"" is dominated by emission from just a few nearby massive binary systems.\n",1,

Cavity size depends on black hole mass, spin, and relative accretion direction, and so given a mass estimate, measurement of ISCO size constrains SMBH spin; such a measurement would be invaluable in determining the role of spin in AGN emission processes, and also in understanding SMBH growth by constraining the magnitude of accretion events. While not spatially resolvable, ISCO cavities are expected to leave a signature on the light curves of gravitationally lensed quasars when they undergo a strong microlensing event. Using simulations of these events for Q2237+030, the Einstein Cross, we have shown that ISCO width can be measured using current observatories if monitored through a cusp-crossing microlensing event.\n",3,

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) study of the nucleus of NGC 404. Previous 5 GHz VLA observations at a spatial resolution of 0.4” revealed compact radio emission co-located with a hard X-ray nuclear point source and the optical center of the galaxy, within the known errors. This was interpreted as evidence that the candidate intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the center of NGC 404 is actively accreting material at low levels. However, follow-up milliarcsecond-resolution, very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations did not detect any emission, challenging the accreting IMBH interpretation. Our Ku-band observations bridge the gap in spatial resolution between the previous VLA and VLBI observations, and successfully resolve the radio emission (d ~ 17 pc) previously imaged at lower resolution. In combination with the existing VLA data, the new Ku-band data indicate a steep integrated radio spectral index from 1 to 18 GHz, suggesting the source is dominated by optically-thin synchrotron emission. We build upon the existing multiwavelength observations of this galaxy and provide a re-assessment of the physical origin of the extended radio emission near the center of NGC 404. While an accreting IMBH remains a strong possibility for the origin of the radio source, our new analysis strengthens the case for a supernova remnant origin. We discuss future observational tests needed to distinguish between these scenarios, as well as the importance of accurately determining the properties of the NGC 404 nuclear engine in the context of the fundamental plane of black hole activity.\n",5,

The X-ray binary IC 10 X-1 occupies an important niche as a link between BH-XRBs and Ultra Luminous X-ray Sources (ULX) due to its intermediate luminosity (10<sup>^38</sup> erg/s), and role as a central exemplar of the association of between low metallicity galaxies and maximum BH mass.<br />The most secure and direct dynamical evidence for any BH mass comes from the radial velocity (RV) curve coupled with eclipse timing measurements. We phase-connected X-ray timing data accumulated over a decade with Chandra/XMM, with the optical RV curve, revealing a surprizing simultenaity of mid X-ray eclipse and the maximum blueshift velocity of He II emission lines. Our interpretation is that the optical emission lines originate in a shadowed sector of the WR star's stellar wind which escapes X-ray ionization by the compact object. The RV shifts are therefore a projection effect of the stellar wind, and unrelated to the system's mass function which becomes completely unknown. Chandra, XMM and NuStar datasets present a complex picture of radiative transfer through a photo-ionized wind. A search for the orbital period derivative (P-dot) by X-ray timing offers additonal insights, and we present a simulation for the feasibility of constraining P-dot via optical means.<br />This is a substantial change to our understanding of IC 10 X-1, and with similar results reported for its ""near twin"" NGC 300 X-1, adds new a dimension to the facinating question of the maximum mass for stellar BHs.\n",7,

The light curves were created by summing the continuum portions of the spectrum and subtracting the background. Discrete Fourier Transforms were computed to assess any periodic behavior.

We compare the simulated positive superhump shapes with the shapes obtained from observations, using AW Sge as our model.

We found no evidence of nova shells in any of our images. We therefore cannot say that any of the systems besides V1500 Cyg had nova eruptions, but because not all post-nova systems have detectable shells, we also cannot exclude the possibility of a nova eruption occurring in any of these systems and knocking the rotation out of sync.\n",3,

Rubin,Sessioned,Florida State University; The University of Washington; Space Telescope Science Institute,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Understanding the progenitor mass distribution of supernova explosions is an important observational constraint of stellar evolution theory. Recently, a novel approach was proposed to significantly increase the number of progenitor masses: characterize the progenitor mass of supernova remnants (SNRs) by age-dating the local stellar population. Preliminary statistical analyses suggested that there is a lack of SNRs around the most massive of massive stars. This suggested that there is a maximum mass for core collapse supernova explosions, or there is a bias against finding SNRs associated with the most massive stars. We test for a bias by considering the distribution of SNRs sizes using a Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the distribution of remnants sizes is the same for low mass progenitors and high mass progenitors. This implies that there is no bias against finding SNRs around the most massive progenitors. Our next step is to apply Bayesian statistical inference and obtain the joint probability for all the parameters involved in the statistical distribution model: the minimum mass, maximum mass, and slope of the mass distribution.\n",8,

Even primitive meteorites exhibit carbon deficiencies, suggesting at least one process active prior to the formation of planetesimals. Selective erosion of carbonaceous materials by free oxygen atoms present in the photoactive surface layers of the protoplanetary disk provides one such mechanism for destroying refractory carbon while leaving silicate materials intact. We model this process with a large chemical network in a disk surrounding a T-Tauri star. We find that given sufficient turbulence to loft small grains into the oxidative surface regions of the disk, carbon grains are rapidly converted into CO. These oxidative regions can deplete carbon present in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and small grains (∼0.02-20 μm) by at least two orders of magnitude, enough to explain the deficiencies in meteorites compared to interstellar dust, and extend out to ∼15-20 AU from the central star at the disk surface in our static model. When turbulence is considered, the effects may reach the midplane causing depletion out to ∼1 AU. However, the amount of the total carbon reservoir at these radii that is affected by this mechanism depends on several unconstrained parameters concerning the nature of the disk and refractory carbon sources.\n",1,

Gaspar,Sessioned,University of Arizona / Steward Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Although hundreds of debris disks have been characterized from their infrared spectral energy distributions, the composition of the dust comprising these disks has, in general, not been determined because it is degenerate with the size of the dust grains and their orbital location. Spatially resolved images at multiple wavelengths—including both scattered light and thermal emission—are required to break this degeneracy. The relatively nearby A6 star Beta Pictoris hosts a large, bright, edge-on debris disk that is amenable to a detailed characterization of its composition. We constrain the optical properties (and thus composition) of the dust in this system by simultaneously modelling images in the visible (HST/STIS), near-infrared (HST/WFC3), mid-infrared (Spitzer/MIPS), far-infrared (Herschel/PACS), and sub-mm (ALMA). The HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/MIPS data that we present have not been previously published. We find that a mixture of silicates and organic refractory material can fit this suite of data well. High amounts of water ice and highly porous grains are not favored, which is in agreement with a recent study of the debris disk around HR4796A that also combined thermal and scattered light constraints, but is in contrast with studies of other debris disks that did not include scattered light data. We also find that a model disk composed entirely of silicates will over-predict the scattered light brightness when fit to the thermal data—a discrepancy seen in the modelling attempts of other debris disks that assumed a purely silicate composition.\n",3,

Here we review the new science derived from over a dozen debris disks imaged with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) as part of the GPI Exoplanet Survey (GPIES). In addition to its exquisite imaging capability, GPI's polarimetric mode provides invaluable insight on the dust content of each disk, in most cases for the very first time. These early results typically reveal narrow belts of material with evacuated regions roughly 50-100 AU in radius, subtle asymmetries in structure and high degree of linear polarization.

Here, we investigate the case of RCW 49, for which the Cosmic Background Imager tentatively (~  3 sigma) detected Anomalous Microwave Emission at 31 GHz on angular scales of 7'. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we carried out a multi-frequency (5 GHz, 19 GHz and 34 GHz) continuum study of the region, complemented by observations of the H109 alpha radio recombination line. The analysis shows that: 1) the spatial correlation between the microwave and IR emission persists on angular scales from 3.4' to 0.4'', although the degree of the correlation slightly decreases at higher frequencies and on smaller angular scales; 2) the spectral indices between 1.4 and 5 GHz are globally in agreement with optically thin free-free emission, however, ~ 30 % of these are positive and much greater than -0.1, consistently with a stellar wind scenario; 3) no major evidence for inverted free-free radiation is found, indicating that this is likely not the cause of the Anomalous Emission in RCW 49. Although our results cannot rule out the spinning dust hypothesis to explain the tentative detection of Anomalous Microwave emission in RCW 49, they emphasize the complexity of astronomical sources very well known and studied such as HII regions, and suggest that, at least in these objects, the reported excess of emission<br />might be ascribed to alternative mechanisms such as stellar winds and shocks.\n",5,

As part of an ongoing effort to measure mass loss from evolved stars in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds, we are modeling mass loss from AGB and RSG stars in these galaxies. Our approach is twofold. We pursue radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGB and RSG stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and in the Galactic bulge and in globular clusters of the Milky Way. We are also constructing detailed dust opacity models of AGB and RSG stars in these galaxies for which we have infrared spectra; e.g., from the <i>Spitzer Space Telescope</i> Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Our sample of infrared spectra largely comes from <i>Spitzer</i>-IRS observations. The detailed dust modeling of spectra informs our choice of dust properties to use in radiative transfer modeling of SEDs.

J. Scott*,N. J. Scott*,Sessioned,"Georgia State University, Astronomy Dept","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Near-infrared long-baseline optical interferometry has provided the first unambiguous resolved detections of hot dust around main sequence stars (Absil et al. 2006). This showed that an unexpectedly dense population of (sub)micrometer dust grains close exists to their sublimation temperature of approximately 1400K. A later survey (Absil et al. 2013) revealed that these ""hot exozodiacal disks"" are relatively common around spectral type A-K stars. Current models of circumstellar debris disks suggest that in the inner region, within 1 AU, of the disk the timescale for complete removal of submicron dust is on the order of a few years (Wyatt 2008). The presence of dust close to the star is surprising because most cold debris belts detected are collisionally dominated. Mutual collisions grind the dust down to the size where radiation pressure pushes the dust out before Poynting-Robertson drag has a chance to pull the dust inward. Competing models exist to explain the persistence of this dust; some of which suggest that dust production is a punctuated and chaotic process fueled by asteroid collisions and comet infall that would show variability on timescales of a few years.<br />High precision long-baseline interferometry observations in the K-band with the FLUOR (Fiber Linked Unit for Optical Recombination) beam combiner at the CHARA (Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy) Array provided the data for these exozodiacal dust detections. This original instrument has undergone upgrades as part of JouFLU (Jouvence of FLUOR) project. The new instrument has been used to expand the original survey and to re-observe stars from the previous exozodiacal disk survey to search for predicted variations in the detected disks. We have found evidence that for some systems the amount of circumstellar flux from these previously detected exozodiacal disks, or exozodis, has varied greatly. The flux from some exozodis has increased, others decreased, and for a few the amount has remained constant. These results are intriguing and will undoubtedly be useful for future modeling of this phenomenon. Furthermore, long-term monitoring is suggested for some of these objects to confirm detections and determine the rate of variation.\n",7,

Here we investigate the probability of finding such a high-velocity pair in large-volume N-body simulations, particularly focusing on differences between halo finding algorithms. We find that algorithms that do not account for the kinematics of infalling groups yield vastly different statistics and probabilities. When employing the Rockstar (RS) halo finder that considers particle velocities, we find numerous Bullet-like pair candidates that closely match not only the high pairwise velocity, but also the mass, mass ratio, separation distance, and collision angle of the initial conditions that have been shown to produce the Bullet Cluster in non-cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The probability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with M<sub>halo</sub>≥10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> is 4.6×10<sup>-4 </sup>using RS, while it is ≈34× lower using a friends-of-friends (FOF) based approach as in previous studies. This is because the typical spatial extent of Bullet progenitors is such that FOF tends to group them into a single halo despite clearly distinct kinematics. Further requiring an appropriately high average mass among the two progenitors, we find the comoving number density of potential Bullet-like candidates to be on the order of ≈10<sup>-10 </sup>Mpc<sup>-3</sup>. Our findings suggest that ΛCDM straightforwardly produces massive, high relative velocity halo pairs analogous to Bullet Cluster progenitors, and hence the Bullet Cluster does not present a challenge to the ΛCDM model.\n",6,

Though many theories have been proposed, it is not yet clear which mechanism is most important for migration, and by extension, in which types of planetary system we can expect a greater prevalence of disruptive gas giant migration. One way to constrain this process is to observe the orbital properties of migrating planets, which are expected to be shaped according to the mode of migration: in general, interaction with the gas disk should produce circular, coplanar orbits, while multi-body processes stir up eccentricities and inclinations. Unfortunately, tidal and magnetic interactions between hot Jupiters and their host stars can obscure these differences by damping eccentricities and inclinations over time, so the most direct constraints will come from difficult-to-observe young systems. Additional constraints on migration can be obtained by observing the architectures of systems containing short-period giant planets: if an outer companion is often responsible for driving migration, there should be a higher incidence of massive companions on wide orbits in hot Jupiter systems than in systems not hosting a short-period giant planet. Further, the properties of these outer companions can help differentiate between multi-body migration mechanisms. We describe two complementary surveys that we have carried out to address these problems. The first, a precise radial-velocity survey in nearby adolescent (100-600 Myr) open clusters, characterizes the orbits of giant planets soon after migration. The second, an adaptive optics imaging survey of hot Jupiter host stars, constrains the population of wide companions in hot Jupiter systems. We present the results from these two surveys and discuss the orbital properties and system architectures of our discoveries in the context of giant planet migration.\n",2,

Wang*,S. Wang*; J. Wright,Sessioned,Pennsylvania State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The synergy between Kepler and the ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys have made numerous discoveries of small and rocky exoplanets, opening the age of Earth analogs. However, most (29/33) of the RV-detected exoplanets that are smaller than 3 Earth radii do not have their masses constrained to better than 20% - limited by the current RV precision (1-2 m/s). Our work improves the RV precision of the Keck telescope, which is responsible for most of the mass measurements for small Kepler exoplanets. We have discovered and verified, for the first time, two of the dominant terms in Keck's RV systematic error budget: modeling errors (mostly in deconvolution) and telluric contamination. These two terms contribute 1 m/s and 0.6 m/s, respectively, to the RV error budget (RMS in quadrature), and they create spurious signals at periods of one sidereal year and its harmonics with amplitudes of 0.2-1 m/s. Left untreated, these errors can mimic the signals of Earth-like or Super-Earth planets in the Habitable Zone. Removing these errors will bring better precision to ten-year worth of Keck data and better constraints on the masses and compositions of small Kepler planets. As more precise RV instruments coming online, we need advanced data analysis tools to overcome issues like these in order to detect the Earth twin (RV amplitude 8 cm/s). We are developing a new, open-source RV data analysis tool in Python, which uses Bayesian MCMC and Gaussian processes, to fully exploit the hardware improvements brought by new instruments like MINERVA and NASA's WIYN/EPDS.\n",3,

With CSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility atop Mauna Kea (R~46,000), we have completed a PRV 2.3 micron survey to detect exoplanets around ~30 red, low mass, and young stars.  We are able to reach long-term radial velocity dispersions of ~30 m/s on our survey targets.  We are following up candidate RV variables, and have confirmed other previously known RV variables.  With a spectral grasp of only 5 nm at 2.3 microns, this performance with CSHELL is limited by detector artifacts, and fringing in the data and flatfields.   iSHELL will replace CSHELL at IRTF, with first light expected in April 2016.  iSHELL is a 1.15-5.4 micron high spectral resolution (R~70,000) immersion grating, cross-dispersed, white pupil spectrograph.  With iSHELL we should be able to obtain a precision of less than 5 m/s in the NIR with iSHELL from the improvements in spectral grasp alone.<br />\n",4,

Purpose built for exoplanet detection and characterization, 80% of the telescope's observing time is dedicated to these science goals. The APF has demonstrated 1 m/s radial velocity precision on bright, RV standard stars and performs with the same speed-on-sky as Keck/HIRES when observing M-dwarfs.<br /><br />The telesope is fully automated for RV operations, using a dynamic scheduler that makes informed decisions on which targets to observe based on scientific interest, desired cadence, required precision levels and current observing conditions, all on a minute-to-minute basis. This ensures that time is not wasted chasing non-optimal targets on nights with poor conditions and enables rapid changes to the overall science observing strategy.<br /><br />The APF has contributed to the detection of four planetary systems in its first two years of scientific operations. Our most recent detection is that of a 6-planet system around the bright (V=5.5), nearby (d=6.5pc), K3V star HD 219134. The planets in this system have masses ranging from 3.5 to108 M<sub>Earth</sub>, with orbital periods from 3 to 2247 days. An independent detection of the inner 4 planets in this system by the HARPS-N team has shown that the 3d planet transits the star, making this system ideal for follow-up observations.<br /><br />I will discuss the design and implementation of the APF's dynamic scheduler, the telescope's planet detections to date, overall performance results of the telescope and our future observing strategy.\n",5,

Lim*,D. Lim*; Y. Lee,Sessioned,Yonsei University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent studies of stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) are facing a new paradigm as more and more GCs are observed to have multiple populations. In order to investigate the origin of these multiple stellar populations, we have performed low-resolution spectroscopy for red giant branch stars in M22, NGC 288, NGC 362, NGC 1851, NGC 6266, NGC 6273, NGC 6626, NGC 6642, NGC 6723, and 47 Tuc. We find significant differences in CN band strength for every sample GCs. However, the differences in calcium abundance (HK’ index) between CN-strong and CN-weak subpopulations are found only in M22, NGC 1851, and NGC 6273. This difference in heavy elements would imply that later generation stars were enriched by Type II supernovae. In addition, we find interesting differences in CN-CH relation among sample GCs. While CN and CH are anti-correlated in normal GCs, which show no difference in calcium abundance, they show positive correlations in M22 and NGC 6273. NGC 1851, however, shows no difference in CH between the two groups of stars with different CN strengths. We suggest that all of these systematic differences would be best explained by how strongly supernovae enrichment has contributed to the chemical evolution of these GCs.\n",1,

Jacobson,Sessioned,Indiana University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent spectroscopic studies of open clusters (OCs) show large increases in a few slow neutron-capture (s-process) element abundances, primarily Ba, for the youngest clusters, contradicting previous models of AGB star nucleosynthesis. These observations have prompted theorists to add new factors to models of low-mass (M < 1.5M<sub>⊙</sub>) AGB star interiors to inflate yields <i>ad hoc</i>. However, these supersolar abundances in young clusters are based primarily on Ba lines which are extremely strong in most OC stars and display hyperfine and isotopic structure. We have assembled a sample of 68 red giant stars from 23 OCs and have measured eleven neutron-capture elements; here we focus on Ba and five other s-process elements (La, Ce, Sr, Y, and Zr) to see if the trends with age match that observed for Ba. Our OC sample ranges in age from 0.2 - 10 Gyr and covers 7.5 < R<sub>GC</sub> < 16.5 kpc.<br /><br />We find that [Ba/Fe] with cluster age does have a large, statistically significant downward trend with age (~ -0.04 dex/Gyr), but all other s-process elements have more modest trends (~ -0.02 dex/Gyr) that are not as significant and are mostly driven by the oldest cluster in our sample, Be 17. We explore other correlations between families of s-process elements as well. The puzzle of the disagreement between Ba and other s-process abundances leads us to question the reliability of the commonly measured Ba lines.\n",2,

The observations were obtained exploiting the exceptional high-resolution capabilities of the near-IR camera GSAOI combined with the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System at the GEMINI South Telescope. The images in the J and K bands are generally sub-0.1"", only slightly larger than the diffraction limit of the telescope, yielding the deepest and most accurate color–magnitude diagrams obtained so far from the ground for these clusters. We derived the structural and physical properties of both clusters, supplementing the GEMS data with data from the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea project. We were also able to investigate the age of NGC 6624. We find that Liller 1 is significantly less concentrated and less extended than previously thought. We estimated the mass of Liller 1 to be 2.3 million solar masses, comparable to that of the most massive clusters in the Galaxy. Also, Liller 1 has the second-highest collision rate among all star clusters in the Galaxy, thus confirming that it is an ideal environment for the formation of collisional objects (such as millisecond pulsars).

Rasio,Sessioned,CIERA-Northwestern University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent observations have revealed the existence of stellar mass black holes in globular clusters. These discoveries likely indicate the existence of large populations of black holes that are still bound in these clusters. This is in direct contrast to the past understanding that at most a few black holes can remain bound to an old cluster due to rapid mass segregation and dynamical ejection. Modern realistic star-by-star numerical simulations suggest that the retention fraction of stellar mass black holes is typically much higher than what was previously thought. The retention fraction over time depends intricately on the details of initial cluster properties as well as black hole formation physics. The presence of a population of black holes dramatically alters the cluster's evolution and even survival. I will present results from our latest numerical simulations with a focus on the observable global properties of star clusters that might serve as indicators of the presence of a large population of retained black holes.\n",5,

R. Ayres*,T. R.

The latter two instruments have contributed by far the lion's share of <i>HST</i>'s spectroscopic archive: STIS, because of its longevity (thirteen years in operation so far, although with a hiatus between 2004-2009); and COS because of its high sensitivity, which allows efficient observations, and thus many more targets in a typical GO program. STIS benefits from a compact echelle design, and the sharp stable imaging of <i>HST</i>, to provide high-resolution (3-7 km s<sup>-1</sup>) spectra of bright objects, including stars, nebulae, quasars, novae, and so forth. COS achieves astounding sensitivity in the FUV by a sophisticated design that compensates for the spherical abberation of <i>HST</i>'s primary mirror, disperses the target's light, and focuses the spectral image all with just a single optical element. While the spectral resolution of COS (about 18 km s<sup>-1</sup>) is not as high as that of STIS, it is adequate for diverse investigations, including faint broad-lined AGN at the edge of the Universe, hot stars in nearby galaxies, and magnetically active planet-hosting red dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. Thanks in part to the ""UV Initiative"" in recent <i>HST</i> proposal cycles, there have been several large efforts involving both STIS and COS, to assemble important spectral collections, including full UV atlases of representative hot and cool stars at high resolution with STIS; long time series of archetype AGN (""reverberation mapping"") with COS; and hundreds of sightlines to distant quasars to probe the Cosmic Web, also with COS. Altogether, these diverse spectral observations constitute one of the key legacies of <i>HST,</i> and hopefully one that will continue to be built upon in the coming years.\n",6,

We follow a group of seven DHH youth over one semester as they interact with the SJS tools and curriculum to understand how they assimilate astronomy experiences and benefit from access to telescopes both directly (on school campus and at Yerkes Observatory) and through Skynet’s robotic telescope network (optical and radio telescopes, inquiry-based modules, data analysis tools, and professional astronomers). We report on our first findings of resources and best practices for engaging DHH youth in astronomy in the future.\n",5,

Studying the relationship between the interstellar fuel out of which stars form, and the global changes that galaxies undergo provides a window not only into the paths of transitions that galaxies take, but also how the transition mechanisms can feed back upon the relationship between molecular gas and star formation. I will discuss our results from z=0 transitioning galaxy surveys from CARMA and IRAM, and the ways in which next generation radio telescopes will not only provide detailed insights into the relationship between gas and transition at z=0, but also how this relationship evolves with redshift.\n",1,

Galactic conformity, where red galaxies preferentially surround other red galaxies at fixed mass, is used as a probe of galaxy assembly bias — the picture in which environmental factors and assembly history, other than dark matter halo mass, are necessary to understand the halo occupation statistics of galaxies. Using the Illustris suite of simulations, we demonstrate how a galactic conformity signal at z = 0 can arise from a combination of the underlying dark matter clustering as a function of halo formation age and a galaxy color–halo age relation. With observations from the PRIMUS redshift survey, we probe the deprojected 3D galactic conformity signal as a function of redshift over the range 0.2 < z < 1. Together, these results motivate further observations to discern the effect size of to discern the effect size of the galactic conformity signal, its variation in redshift, and what baryonic processes, such as feedback or accretion, play a dominant role in its creation.\n",2,

Unfortunately, galactic outflows are difficult to observe and characterize because they are extremely diffuse, and contain gas at many different temperatures. Here we present results from a sample of 37 nearby (z < 0.27) star forming galaxies observed in the ultraviolet with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The sample covers over three decades in stellar mass and star formation rate, probing different morphologies such as dwarf irregulars and high-mass merging systems. Using four different UV absorption lines (O I, Si II, Si III and Si IV) that trace a wide range of temperatures (ionization potentials between 13.6 eV and 45 eV), we find shallow correlations between the outflow velocity or the equivalent width of absorption lines with stellar mass or star formation rate. Absorption lines probing different temperature phases have similar centroid velocities and line widths, indicating that they are comoving. Using the equivalent width ratios of the four different transitions, we find the ratios to be consistent with photo-ionized outflows, with moderately strong ionization parameters. By constraining the ionization mechanism we model the ionization fractions for each transition, but find the ionization fractions depend crucially on input model parameters. The shallow velocity scalings imply that low-mass galaxies launch outflows capable of escaping their galactic potential, while higher mass galaxies retain all of their gas, unless they undergo a merger.\n",3,

It is quite possible that infall (e.g. cold mode accretion) and outflow (e.g. a blowout) occur together, leading to complex gas structures. We are conducting a study of rich complexes of narrow CIV absorption lines to find direct evidence for cold mode accretion and gaseous fragments shredded and dispersed by powerful outflows. Study of these rich complexes will provide us critical information of gas, such as velocity, ionization, metallicity, column density, kinetic energy, etc. The information could help us to understand the gas origins. We search SDSS, VLT and Keck archives for quasars with complex multi-component CIV systems or/and strong infalling systems. We obtain particular interesting results for the quasar Q0119-046. The spectra show rich infalling and partial covering complexes. The electron density of the gas is ~10<sup>3.4</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, and the gas is at a distance ~3.6 kpc from the central source. The gas is metal poor and seems to be infalling at the speed ~70 km/s into the galaxy. And it appears to partially cover the continuum source, requiring absorber size scales less than 0.01 pc. This result for very small clouds on galactic ($>$ kpc) scales is unusual but not unprecedented. It may provide evidence that the clouds are fragments from a shredded cloud, dispersed by an unseen high-speed quasar-driven outflow.\n",4,

A warm dark matter universe should have a lower (CIB) than a cold dark matter universe due to the suppression of low mass halos.  Future deep surveys will resolve fainter high redshift galaxies, eventually resolving the halo mass threshold of typical warm dark matter models.  Any remaining unresolved component of the CIB attributable to redshift ~10 sources will reflect the luminosity function of faint galaxies in low mass halos.  If we live in a warm dark matter universe, then we should be able to ""resolve away"" the high redshift galactic stellar contribution to the diffuse CIB.  However, if we live in a CDM universe, some diffuse background from stars in small high redshift halos should remain.  Recent measurements of the CIB suggest a large component due to redshift ~10 galactic UV emission (Mitchell-Wynne et al.) .

Wong*,Sessioned,Caltech,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent improvements in the capabilities of space- and ground-based telescopes as well as data reduction techniques have enabled us to characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets in exquisite detail, revealing a diverse range of properties. Phase curve observations, which track the variation in the infrared brightness of a planet throughout its orbit, allow us to create a full longitudinal temperature profile of the planet. In conjunction with model-generated light curves, these data are invaluable for constraining fundamental properties of the atmosphere, including the efficiency of heat transport from the day side to the night side, the spatial distribution of clouds, and the presence of chemical gradients between the two hemispheres.  A comparison of the day-night thermal flux differences for the 11 planets with previously-published phase curve observations suggests that the most highly-irradiated planets tend to have systematically less efficient day-night heat recirculation. To further study this trend, we have obtained multiband infrared phase curves for three additional highly-irradiated planets – WASP-14b, WASP-19b, and HAT-P-7b. By combining observations spanning multiple wavelengths, we are able to probe different depths in their atmospheres and to construct low-resolution day side and night side emission spectra, which can reveal differences in atmospheric composition between the day and night sides. These planets cover a wide range of orbital eccentricities and host star temperature. In addition, we supplement our analysis of HAT-P-7b with an optical <i>Kepler </i>phase curve. We compare the results of our analysis with a suite of atmospheric models to infer various properties of these atmospheres. We also place our results in the wider context of other planets with published thermal phase curves in order to assess the interplay between irradiation, atmospheric chemistry, and orbital characteristics in driving atmospheric dynamics.<br />\n",1,

In this contribution I will discuss the application of powerful atmospheric retrieval approaches to spectroscopic phase curve data, specifically the WFC3+Spitzer IRAC observations of the hot-Jupiter WASP-43b.  First I will show the variation in thermal structures and molecular abundances with phase, assuming each phase is independent. Secondly, I will present a new framework for performing a joint retrieval on multiple phases simultaneously.  In such a framework, I will test, via Bayesian hypothesis testing, a variety of assumptions. For instance, can the absorption features across all phases be explained with a global metallicity and C-to-O ratio under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium? Can chemical quenching perturb the abundances on the cooler phases more than the hotter phases? Can we tell the difference?  Can a global thermal structure “shape” explain all phases or is there structure variation with phase?

In addition to detection, the precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used to study the atmospheres on these planets. However, the interpretation of these observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase curves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets. With a newly established semi-analytical model framework, we show that a hot exoplanet<b>’</b>s visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant phase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class requires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and the other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the substellar point.

The phase curves of these planets feature post-occultation phase offsets, best explained by reflective clouds located on the west side of the substellar point.

Recently observations of the light reflected by Hot Jupiters atmospheres shed a new light on the cloud distribution on the dayside of these planets : for a handful of planets clouds are more abundant on the western than on the eastern side of the dayside hemisphere and, more importantly, this asymmetry depends on the equilibrium temperature of the planet.<br />Here we use a grid of 3D global circulation models to show that a single cloud species is unable to explain the recent Kepler observations. The cloud asymmetry on the dayside is a strong function of the condensation temperature of the cloud species which allow us to determine the composition of the clouds present in these planets. We show that a transition between silicate clouds and sulfide clouds appear at equilibrium temperatures of 1600K. A mechanism such as the presence of a deep cold trap is necessary to explain this transi- tion. Furthermore, we show that the western limb temperature is always cold, independently of the equilibrium temperature of the planet, allowing cloud particles to form even in the most irradiated planets as seen in the observations.<br />Our results provide the first evidence for a transition in the cloud species of hot Jupiters similar to the L/T Brown Dwarf transition.

Those modulations are induced by both gravitational and atmospheric processes. Gravitational processes include the beaming effect (aka Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal distortion, and the atmospheric processes include reflected light and thermal emission by the secondary atmosphere. Therefore, non-eclipsing systems are detectable using photometry alone. The availability of <i>Kepler</i> data for a large sample of stars combined with the sensitivity to non-eclipsing systems has the potential of transforming the <i>Kepler</i> survey into the equivalent of a radial velocity (RV) survey of a large sample of stars with a wide range of spectral type. This allows detecting intrinsically rare systems, where traditional approaches, e.g., RV and transit surveys, are highly inefficient. Those include systems where the companion is a brown-dwarf or a massive planet, or even a white dwarf. As this approach is still in its infancy, we are carrying out RV follow-up of <i>Kepler</i> photometric detections, to confirm the nature of the system and measure the orbit and the companion’s mass. Here we present our results from an RV campaign with the WIYN/Hydra multi-fiber spectrograph, where we used 26 nights so far during the 2014 and 2015 <i>Kepler</i> observing seasons to observe 5 Hydra one-degree diameter fields within the <i>Kepler</i> field.

From these measurements has emerged a 6-parameter cosmological “standard model”: a flat universe filled with dark matter and dark energy and seeded by  a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of Gaussian random-phase density perturbations.    The striking resemblance between these perturbations and those expected from inflation motivates the search for a unique ""B-mode” signature of inflation in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.  While the fluctuation spectrum is close to scale invariant, WMAP, Planck and ground-based CMB experiments now have  strong evidence for a departure from scale invariance in primordial perturbations.  This suggests, in simple models of inflation that these B modes should be within striking distance within the next 5-10 years.  The advent of a new generation of galaxy surveys will, over similar timescales, shed additional light not only on the physics of inflation, but also the nature of the dark matter and dark energy required by the current cosmological standard model, and perhaps on the new physics that determines the baryon density.\n",1,

For this purpose we have used optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) obtained with the GMOS-IFU at Gemini North telescope and performed IDL codes to analyze the spectra. We have found that the [OIII] emission line can be observed all around the object and that it presents a higher blueshift to the South West direction. On the other hand, the Hβ line is better observed around the nucleus and it presents an apparent rotation. Also, the ratio between these two emission lines is typical of a Seyfert galaxy according to the BPT diagram and typical of an AGN based on the study of Lamareille et al. 2004, that uses the ratio between [OII]3727 and Hβ for the study instead of [NII]/Hα like the BPT diagram does.

Results verify those from previous smaller samples in which Seyferts are found to have both geometrically and optically thick nuclear disk of molecular gas, as traced by the 1-0 S(1) H<sub>2</sub> 2.12 μm emission. A comparison of the flux distribution of the nuclear gas disks in Seyfert 1s versus 2s was completed. Seyfert 1s have, on average, a half-width-half-maximum value of 29 +/- 16 pc, while Seyfert 2s have, on average, a half-width-half-maximum value of 41 +/- 25 pc. A comparison of the characteristics of the nuclear kinematics in Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s will also be presented.\n",2,

Mass outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) drive gas away from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) into the circumnuclear environment, and may play an important role in regulating the growth of the SMBH, and its coevolution with the host galaxy bulge. Recent work by Crenshaw et al. (2015, ApJ, 799, 83) found that the mass outflow rate in the NLR of NGC 4151 is too large for the outflowing mass to have originated only from the central region, indicating a significant amount of gas is picked up by the outflow as it travels away from the nucleus. Using archival spectra taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), we are working to determine the mass outflow rates in a sample of 10 Seyfert galaxies to determine if correlations exist between their outflows and other properties including galaxy luminosity. To accomplish this, we will analyze the emission line spectra using photoionization models to determine the mass of the outflowing gas. Combining this information with previous kinematic modeling from Fischer et al. (2013, ApJS, 209, 1), we can determine the mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities as a function of radius from the nucleus. These quantities will provide a direct comparison between observation and theoretical feedback models, allowing us to determine the significance of these outflows in regulating AGN feedback.\n",6,

Past observations of NGC 4151 show high variability in the continuum flux, and our data found the galaxy in a very low flux state, in both X-Ray and UV. We propose an X-Ray model consistent of an intrinsic broken powerlaw continuum, attenuated by absorber components with a range of ionization and column densities. Preliminary analysis of the UV data rules out the possibility of a larger column density, as proposed by Kraemer et. al (2005) for a similar low flux state dataset from 2000. Instead, we suggest the presence of an additional, highly ionized absorber.  In our model, the three main components of absorption span a range of radial distances, with the nearer ones filtering the ionizing radiation incident on the further ones. The changes in absorption appear to be principally due to the changes in ionization state/opacity of the individual components.\n",9,

Badr,Sessioned,Notre Dame University-Louaize; IMEC; Lebanese University II,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The accretion mode and the dominant power source in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are still elusive. We focus on a sample of 22 LINER 1.9s (Ho et al. 1997), a subclass of LINERs that show broad Halpha lines, a signature of blackhole-powered accretion, to test the hypothesis that the ionizing continuum emitted by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) could lead to the LINER ultraviolet (UV) emission-line ratios. Optical line-ratio diagrams are a weak diagnostic tool in distinguishing between possible power sources (Sabra et al. 2003). We search the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) for UV spectra of the objects in the above sample and also perform photoionization simulations using CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 2013). Unfortunately, only one object (NGC 1052; Gabel et al. 2000) of the 22 LINER 1.9s has UV spectra that cover many emission lines; the rest of the objects either do not have any UV spectra, the spectral coverage is in-adequate, or the spectra have very low signal-to-noise ratios. Our photoionization simulations set up two identical grids of clouds with a range of densities and ionization parameters. We illuminate one grid with radiation emitted by a thin accretion disk (AD) and we illuminate the other grid with radiation from a RIAF. We overplot the UV emission-line ratio predictions for AD and RIAF illumination, together with the available line ratios for NGC 1052. Initial results show that UV lines could be used as diagnostics for the accretion mode in AGN. More UV spectral coverage of LINER 1.9s is needed in order to more fully utilize the diagnostic powers of UV emission line ratios.\n",11,

We find that real AGN accretion disks have a flatter radial temperature gradient than predicted by standard accretion disk theory. We investigate quantitatively how this flatter temperature gradient increases the predicted sizes of emitting regions as a function of wavelength. We find that, while our flatter temperature gradient improves the fit to multi-wavelength reverberation mapping observations and reduces the disk-size-discrepancy problem, it does not eliminate it. This supports the proposal of Gaskell (2015) that much of the size discrepancy problem is due to underestimating AGN luminosities by neglecting the substantial internal extinction of AGNs.\n",15,

Significant variability structure on timescales up to a few days was revealed by the high time resolution (~30 minutes) of Kepler Satellite.

To probe Kepler AGN, recent studies have investigated the suitability of sophisticated models like CARMA processes to better understand dominant mechanisms driving observed variability across these timescales. By testing models against AGN photometry, we gain insights about accretion physics, intrinsic differences between AGN sub-types, and physical scales pertaining to orbits or casually connected matter flows.

An important ingredient in these evolutionary models is galactic interaction and mergers. Consequently, we expect to see dual active galactic nuclei at the early stages of an interaction and close, bound binary black holes after the parent galaxies have merged. While binary active galactic nuclei have been detected at large separations, it has proven difficult to detect close, bound binaries. Our team has been carrying out an observing campaign to find binary black holes with sub-parsec separations. Thus, we have been studying a sample of 88 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey whose broad Hβ lines are offset from their nominal wavelength by a few thousand km/s. These offsets suggest orbital motion of one of the black holes and the gas that is bound to it. In this work, we play devil's advocate by exploring an alternative interpretation of the broad emission lines. We ask whether lines formed in a perturbed, non-axisymmetric disks can have profiles similar to those observed. Two categories of non-axisymmetric disks are explored - one with a prominent spiral arm and one that is elliptical. To make the model as general as possible, the radial emissivity of the disk was allowed to have a broken power-law profile. For certain combinations of model parameters, these models can match the observed profile shapes. A subset of these model parameters can mimic the sinusoidal procession of the peak velocity we would expect to see in a binary system on an observable time scale. However, the predominate, observed statistical trend between the Pearson Skewness and the peak position is not reproduced; instead, other trends are predicted by the models that we do not observe.\n",17,

Though candidates of wide-separation dual active galactic nuclei have been detected, there is no reliable evidence for the expected close, bound binaries at separations of one parsec or less.  We are searching for close SBHBs among z<0.7 SDSS quasars with offset broad emission lines.  Specifically, we test the idea that, if one of the black holes is active, the orbital motion within the binary will cause its broad emission lines to exhibit periodic radial velocity shifts.  Among the most significant caveats to this approach is that the variability of the broad Hβ profile may mimic radial velocity changes.  Cases where the flux increases in one side of the line profile and decreases in the other are of particular concern.  In order to test the extent of this problem, we introduce simulated profile variability into the observed spectra of the binary candidates and then make radial velocity measurements on the Hβ lines.  We will present the results of this simulation to assess how often we will measure false radial velocity shifts as a result of changes in the shape of the broad Hβ profile.\n",18,

Mason,Sessioned,University of Oregon; Gemini Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In 1995 and 1996, Maoz et al. concluded that the nearby galaxy NGC 4736 (d=16 million light years) is in the late stages of a merger event. After further investigation, in 2005, Maoz et al. observed UV variability in the nuclear region of NGC 4736, revealing a second unknown source in the nucleus. Since late stage mergers are an ideal location to search for binary black holes (BBH), members of our team hypothesized that the second source could be a second black hole, making this a potential BBH system. This is important since observational evidence for their existence remains sparse, even though BBH are predicted by many theories and potentially play an important role in galaxy evolution. In January of 2008, NGC 4736 was observed with the GMOS-N instrument on Gemini North. Optical longslit spectra of the nuclear region were obtained with spatial resolution of 0.1454''/pixel and a spectral resolution of R~1700. At this resolution, the two nuclear sources are spatially resolved at a projected separation of 2.5''. As a result, we can classify the nature of the second source by looking at the optical line ratios following Ho et al. (1997). High signal-to-noise spectra of the unknown source displayed strong emission of [SII] and [NII], but an extremely weak [OIII] emission line. The unknown source has a calculated [NII]/[Hα] ratio of 1.37 and an upper limit of 0.6 for the [OIII]/[Hβ] ratio. Placing the unknown source on the BPT-NII diagram (Baldwin et al., 1981), we tentatively conclude that it is a low-luminosity second black hole potentially making NGC 4736 the nearest BBH system. The result will enable future high-spectral and spatial resolution observations of a low-luminosity system in extremely late stages of merging, which will be a significant step forward in validating models of galaxy mergers and AGN activity.\n",19,

With a projected separation of 7.3 pc, this system is the most compact supermassive binary black hole, which makes it one of the best candidates to study. Understanding the motion of the merging black holes, and the dynamics of this system are important to understanding the evolution and formation of galaxies.

Yan et al. 2015 recently proposed that Mrk 231 is a black-hole binary system with very little intrinsic reddening, in which the large black hole experiences advection dominated accretion, emitting little continuum, while the accretion disk of the small black hole emits as an ordinary quasar, dominating the observed weak UV continuum and the photoionizing flux.<br /><br />Using Cloudy photo-ionization modeling, recombination broad lines in the relatively unreddened near-IR, and CIV and CIII] lines in the reddened UV, we show that the observed line emission is not consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis. The observed near-IR recombination line flux is too strong to be produced by the weak continuum of the putative small black hole. Moreover, the lack of intrinsic reddening in the binary model implies a small intrinsic CIV/IR line ratio from the observed lines, which would in turn require a very low ionization parameter that would under-predict the observed near-IR recombination line flux.\n",21,

Beasley,Sessioned,University of Puget Sound; National Radio Astronomy Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Due to its incredible resolving power, the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) allows astronomers to view radio emission from celestial objects in incredible detail. This makes the VLBA the best instrument for studying the dynamics of active galactic nuclei, or compact regions at the centers of galaxies where black holes are thought to reside. Since most galaxies harbor supermassive black holes at their centers, and some galaxies merge with others, supermassive binary black hole systems arise. Though a number of these systems have been found, only one system contains black holes within 10 pc apart. During the summer, we analyzed new observations from the VLBA Calibrator Survey (VCS) on approximately 2200 sources in the hopes of detecting more close supermassive binary black hole candidates. Here we present the results from reducing and categorizing these sources. We also discuss the importance of the VCS and its role in enabling observations of the most distant celestial objects.\n",22,

Rothberg,Sessioned,George Mason University; University of Victoria; United States Naval Research Laboratory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): It is now well known that virtually all galaxies host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and that galaxy interactions are ubiquitous. Theory predicts these interactions would funnel gas toward the central regions of galaxies, potentially triggering gas accretion onto the SMBH, causing them to appear as binary active galactic nuclei (AGN).  However, despite decades of searching and strong theoretical reasons that they should exist, observationally confirmed cases of binary AGNs are extremely rare, and most have been discovered serendipitously. Since galaxy mergers are likely to be characterized by dusty environments, it is possible that the optical signatures of a significant number of binary AGNs are obscured.  Observations from the <i>Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</i> (<i>WISE</i>) may hold the key for increasing the rate of discovery of binary AGN in late-stage mergers. Starting with a sample of ~4,000 galaxy pairs, we searched for mid-IR signatures of binary AGNs. In this poster, we report on the detection frequency of binary AGNs identified through mid-infrared observations and explore its dependence on merger stage.\n",23,

Thus, one expects to see close pairs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), or dual AGNs, in a fraction of galaxy mergers. However, finding them remains a challenge. We studied a sample of double-peaked SDSS [O III] AGNs using Keck 2 Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics assisted imaging to find that 30% of double-peaked SDSS AGNs have two spatial components within a 3"" radius. However, the identity of the companion object is not revealed with imaging; X-ray observations can confirm these galaxy pairs as systems containing two AGNs. We performed Chandra X-ray ACIS-S observations on 12 double-peaked candidate dual AGNs with a possible near-infrared companion 1-3"" away. Using our observations and 8 archival observations of additional candidate dual AGNs, we compare the distribution of X-ray photons to our spatially double near-IR images, measure X-ray luminosities and hardness ratios, and estimate column densities. Additionally, we can compare our near-IR spatially double candidates with 7 double-peaked [O III] SDSS AGNs that are spatially single in our near-IR imaging and have archival Chandra ACIS-S observations. By assessing what fraction of double- peaked emission line SDSS AGNs are true dual AGNs, we can better determine whether double-peaked [O III] is an efficient dual AGN indicator and constrain the statistics of dual AGNs\n",25,

While large numbers of type-2 (obscured) AGNs have now been identified (both via spectroscopy and through color-based arguments in the optical, IR, and X-ray), the vast majority of these are low-luminosity objects at z<1, whereas only handfuls of bonafide type-2 quasars are confirmed at redshifts z~2 with bolometric luminosities that are comparable to the typical luminosity of SDSS type-1 quasars. Although some analyses find the density of high-z, type-2 candidates to be three times that of the type-1 population (at similar bolometric luminosity), our revisiting of the problem through an archival spectroscopic search reveals that the confirmed high-z, type-2 population (~0.2/sq deg) is only ~1/3 of the high-z, type-1 quasar population (~0.7/sq. deg) to a depth of WISE W4<8. As most interpretations of the ""unified model"" predict similar numbers type-1 and type-2 quasars, this conspicuous lack of luminous type-2 quasars at high-redshift constitutes a major unsolved problem. We explore a candidate selection algorithm that utilizes the sky area of AllWISE, the depth/resolution of large-area Spitzer-IRAC surveys, and optical data from the SDSS in order to uncover these missing type-2 quasars.\n",29,

While most spatially-resolved jets are seen in the radio, an increasing number have been discovered to emit in the optical/near-IR and/or X-ray bands. Here we discuss a spectacular example of this class, the 3C 111 jet, housed in one of the nearest, double-lobed FR II radio galaxies known. The jet itself extends over 100 kpc on each side, making it one of the longest to be seen in the radio, near-IR/optical and X-ray bands; its length and straight nature makes it ideal for studying jet physics over many kiloparsecs. We discuss new, deep Chandra and HST observations that reveal both near-IR and X-ray emission from several components of the 3C 111 jet, as well as both the approaching and receding hotspots. We also discuss new VLA observations of the jet. The near-IR and X-ray emission in the jet is restricted to several knots, and there are important differences between the morphologies seen in the radio, near-IR bands, and X-ray bands. We analyze the broad-band spectral energy distributions of the jet components. We compare competing models of emission as they relate to frequency-dependent relativistic beaming. Synchrotron emission seems to fit adequately the observed emissions of all knots and hotspots.\n",32,

Jones,Sessioned,Sewanee: The University of the South; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We analyze archival Chandra data of the nearby AGN NGC 1052 to determine the nature of the interaction of the radio lobes with the ambient hot gas.  NGC 1052 is typically classified as a Seyfert galaxy, but has a radio bright core and extended diffuse radio lobes on kpc scales.  We report the detection of X-ray bright shells around the radio lobes, suggestive of compression of the ISM by the supersonic inflation of the lobes. We determine the temperature and density of the gas in these shells and of the ambient ISM.  We find that the temperature of the ISM is 0.8 keV, and that of the shells around the E and W radio lobes are 0.72 and 0.69 keV, respectively fitting a single temperature APEC model.  The statistical quality of the fits is low, so systematic uncertainties dominate our ability to distinguish temperature variations between regions. NGC 1052’s outburst is relatively young (9 x 10<sup>13</sup> sec) and comparatively low power (1.9 x 10<sup>41</sup> erg/sec).  Interestingly, the density jump between the shells and the ambient ISM is larger than the maximum compression allows by the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, suggesting that the emission from the shells is not thermal.  We propose that the bubbles are highly supersonic (Mach number >5) and that the emission of the shell is due to synchrotron radiation from a population of ultrarelativistic electrons created by the powerful shock. If this interpretation is correct, NGC 1052 would be only the second AGN in which this process has been observed.

Quantitatively, SDSS results predict about 0.06 mag rms variability for timescales below 50 days, while CRTS data show about a factor of two larger rms for spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars. Our analysis presented here has successfully resolved this discrepancy as due to slightly underestimated photometric error estimates provided by the CRTS image processing pipelines.

Siemiginowska,Sessioned,Harvard University; Imperial College London; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The gravitational field of a galaxy can act as a lens and deflect the light emitted by a more distant object such as a quasar. If the galaxy is a strong gravitational lens, it can produce multiple images of the same quasar in the sky. Since the light in each gravitationally lensed image traverses a different path length and gravitational potential from the quasar to the Earth, fluctuations in the source brightness are observed in the several images at different times. We infer the time delay between these fluctuations in the brightness time series data of each image, which can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. Our model is based on a state-space representation for irregularly observed time series data generated from a latent continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We account for microlensing variations via a polynomial regression in the model. Our Bayesian strategy adopts scientifically motivated hyper-prior distributions and a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler. We improve the sampler by using an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy, and adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce a profile likelihood of the time delay as an approximation to the marginal posterior distribution of the time delay. The Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing almost identical results; the Bayesian method is more principled but the profile likelihood is faster and simpler to implement.

This seach significantly extended the sampled parameter space in terms of quasar luminosities and redshift coverage. Pioneering studies already demostrate the intrumental role of QSOs in probing the very early phases of galaxy formation and black hole growth within 1 Gyr from the Big Bang: a) billion solar masses black holes are already in place, b) they are surrounded by massive reservoirs of cold gas, and c) the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium rapidly drops after z~6, thus marking the end of the epoch of reionization. Our significantly enlarged sample marks the transition phase from studies of individual sources to statistical studies of the high-z quasar population.

While the origin of this phenomenon is not yet understood, it may lead to new insights into the physics of AGN accretion disks and quasars in general.  While most quasars show such a characteristic time scale and trends, a subset exhibit a time scale that is significantly different than expected given their physical parameters.

For a number of these objects we have now detected significant spectroscopic changes that correlate with the photometric variability.

Mao*,P. Mao*; F. Massaro; C. M. Urry,Sessioned,Yale University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Blazars are ideal laboratories to study relativistic jets in AGN, which are thought to be an important channel for feeding energy into galaxies and clusters. We present multi-wavelength SEDs of 2214 blazars with known redshifts, based on the Roma-BZCAT data across 12 frequency bands ranging from radio to gamma-ray. We confirm the anti-correlation between radio luminosity and synchrotron peak frequency, (part of what defines the ""blazar sequence""), although with greater scatter than seen previously in studies of far fewer blazars. We describe an empirical estimator of luminosities in those 12 frequency bands using only the radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz and the redshift as inputs. Using this estimator, we study the demographics of blazars by comparing Monte-Carlo simulations to blazar surveys at several different frequencies and flux limits. We recover the observed evolutionary parameter for both low-frequency peaked (V/V<sub>max</sub>≈0.6) and high-frequency peaked (V/V<sub>max</sub>≈0.4) blazars, proving that selection effects cause the high-frequency-peaked sources to appear to anti-evolve even though the same underlying evolution was assumed in the simulation. We also show that the if instead we randomly assign fluxes independent of radio luminosity, the simulated blazar samples disagree strongly with the observed ones. These simulations confirm that luminosity and SED shape must indeed be linked in a physical blazar sequence.\n",41,

SMBH’s reside at the centers of most, if not all, massive galaxies and accretion onto those black holes generates a great deal of emission peaking in the UV. These accretion disks are also surrounded by a nearby, fast moving gas region called the Broad Line Region (BLR). As light pulses generated near the black hole spread out, they first illuminate the accretion disk, and then the BLR. For a sample of bright AGN, a dedicated cubesat can follow these changes in brightness on a daily basis for up to 100 days from low Earth orbit. With such monitoring of changes in the accretion disk and then the BLR, an accurate distance between the two regions can be determined. Combining this UV coverage with optical emission-line spectroscopy from the ground allows for a direct measurement of the mass of the central black hole. This exchange of time resolution for spatial resolution can also be used to determine the structure of the central region of the AGN. Ground-based photometric and spectroscopic measurements will complement the UV by tracing the optically emitting and hence cooler regions of the AGN to provide one of the best measurements of supermassive black hole masses.<br /><br />In addition to the primary science mission, the long observing campaigns and the large field of view required to get comparison stars for relative photometry allow for other competitive science. We have identified UV activity in M dwarfs as ancillary science that can be addressed with such a cubesat. This activity will have a strong impact on the habitability of any possible planet around the star.\n",43,

Johnson,Sessioned,Georgia State University; CSIRO,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We investigate the relationship between the black hole mass and galaxy mass for active galactic nuclei (AGN) with direct black hole mass measurements.  Black hole masses were determined from reverberation mapping, which relies on the velocity of the broad line region (BLR) clouds and the light travel time as a measure of the size of the BLR.  We constrain the rotation velocity, and therefore the mass, of each AGN host galaxy with HI spectroscopy obtained at the NRAO Green Bank Telescope.  We also explore the relationship between black hole mass and dark matter mass by constraining the stellar mass component with ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope optical images combined with the integrated HI flux as a constraint the mass of the gas component.  Black hole scaling relations such as these can provide convenient alternatives for large numbers of black hole mass estimates when time and resource constraints preclude black hole mass measurements. Additionally, they can provide constraints for simulations of galaxy evolution and co-evolution with the central black hole.\n",44,

Constraints on the fraction of bulgeless galaxies that host an AGN remain, however, extremely limited.  Following the recent discovery of a large population of bulgeless galaxies with red mid-infrared colors, that are highly suggestive of heated dust by powerful accreting massive black holes, we have employed the Large Binocular Telescope to investigate the near-IR spectra of six of these systems. We present here the data and measurements of near-infrared hydrogen molecular and recombination lines.  We find no evidence for broad components of the Paschen Alpha emission lines, suggesting the AGNs are either too weak or too absorbed to be detected.  Based on new estimates of extinction and comparisons with optical measurements we discuss the likelihood of these systems being heavily obscured AGN or galactic nuclei with vigorous, yet dust embedded star formation.\n",45,

Type I AGN selected from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) were used to establish a correlation between the color and the luminosity of AGN. This work builds on previous NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program team attempts to establish such a relationship. This is novel in that it uses both optical and 1-2 micron near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths as a better color discriminator of the transition between accretion-dominated and dust/torus-dominated emission.<br /><br />Photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was extracted and analyzed for type I AGN with redshifts z < 0.20. Our color-magnitude diagram for the area where the dust vaporizes is analogous to a stellar Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Data from SDSS and 2MASS were specifically selected to focus on the sublimation boundary between the coolest part of the accretion disk and the hottest region of the inner edge of the dusty torus surrounding the accretion disk to find the greatest ratio for the color. The more luminous the AGN, the more extended the dust sublimation radius, causing a larger hot dust emitting surface area, which corresponds to a greater NIR luminosity.<br /><br />Our findings suggest that the best correlations correspond to colors associated with the Sloan z band and any of the 2MASS bands with slight variations dependent on redshift. This may result in a tool for using AGN as a standard for cosmic distances. This research was made possible through the NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) and was funded by NASA Astrophysics Data Program.\n",51,

Noticing that much informal scientific discussion is mediated by sketches—such as those occasionally lively discussions held after hours during scientific conferences—scholars at the CAPER Center for Astronomy & Physics Education Research have been piloting a series of active learning tasks where students are challenged to create scientific drawings to illustrate their understanding of astronomical phenomena or structures. Known informally as <i>Science</i>SKETCHES, examples of these tasks challenge students to illustrate: the spectral curve differences between high and low mass stars; the differences among galaxy shapes; the distribution of stars for the Andromeda Galaxy in terms of luminosity versus temperature; old and young planetary surfaces; or the relationships between distances and speeds of orbiting objects. Although our initial testing has focused on predominately on paper and pencil tasks, with the occasional cell phone picture of a <i>Science</i>SKETCH being texted to the professor, the electronic-based teaching world is nearly ready to support these sorts of drawing tasks. Already, the ability to complete and submit scientific sketches is becoming commonplace across electronic learning platforms, including shared white-boarding in many desktop videoconferencing systems, and handheld device learning systems for interactive classrooms, like those from <i>Learning Catalytics</i>, among many others.

One of the ESSP goals has been to provide pre-service teachers with new or improved science course offerings at Penn State in the Earth and Space Science domains.  In particular, we aim to provide students with opportunities to learn astronomy content knowledge through teaching methods that engage them in investigations where they experience the practices used by astronomers.  We have designed a new course that builds on our research into students' ideas about Solar System astronomy (Plummer et al. 2015) and the curriculum our team created for a professional development workshop for in-service teachers (Palma et al. 2013) with this same theme.  The course was offered for the first time in the spring 2015 semester.  <br /><br />We designed the course using a coherent science content storyline approach (see, e.g., Palma et al. 2014), which requires all of the student investigations to build towards a big idea in science; in this case, we chose the model for formation of our Solar System.  The course led pre-service teachers through a series of investigations that model the type of instruction we hope they will adopt in their own classrooms.  They were presented with a series of research questions that all tie in to the big idea of Solar System formation, and they were responsible for collecting and interpreting their own data to draw evidence-based conclusions about one aspect of this model.  Students in the course were assessed on their astronomy content knowledge, but also on their ability to construct arguments using scientific reasoning to answer astronomy questions.  <br /><br />In this poster, we will present descriptions of the investigations, the assessments used, and our preliminary results about how the course led this group of pre-service teachers to improved understanding of astronomy content and the practices astronomers use in their investigations of the Solar System.<br /><br />We gratefully acknowledge support from the NSF MSP program award DUE#0962792.\n",5,

P. Schleigh*,S. P. Schleigh*; S. Slater; T. F. Slater,Sessioned,East Carolina University; CAPER Center for Astronomy & Physics Education Research; University of Wyoming,"Abstract Body: Going beyond asking students to simply memorize facts about the universe, a longstanding challenge in teaching astronomy centers on successfully teaching students about the nature of science.  As introductory astronomy survey courses, known widely as ASTRO 101, can sometimes be the last science course non-science majoring undergraduates take, many faculty hope to emphasize the scientific enterprise as a broad field in inquiry making valuable contributions to civilization as a whole, rather than as an isolated study of objects far from Earth.  Scholars have long proposed that an understanding of the nature of science as a human endeavor requires explicit instruction. In other words, students successfully learning the facts of astronomy does not in any way ensure that students will learn anything about the nature of how astronomy is done.  In a purposeful effort to improve students’ understanding about the practices and discourse of astronomy, scholars working with the CAPER Center for Astronomy & Physics Education research are developing a suite of carefully designed instructional sequences—called <i>Scientific Argumentation</i>—focused on teaching students the differences between data and evidence, how to communicate and defend evidence-based conclusions, and how to be informed skeptics of scientific claims.  Early results show students moving from naïve understandings of scientific practices to more informed understandings as well as demonstrating enhanced value for science in general as an worthwhile human endeavor with far reaching benefits.\n",6,

Penn State also offers through its fully online World Campus the opportunity for In-Service science teachers to earn an M.Ed. degree in Earth Science, and we currently offer a required online astronomy course for that program. We have previously presented descriptions of how have incorporated research-based pedagogical practices into ESSP-sponsored workshops for in-service teachers (Palma et al. 2013) and into a pilot section of introductory astronomy for non-science majors (Palma et al. 2014). In this presentation, we detail the design and development of a new online astronomy course to be offered through the M.Ed. Earth Science degree program. This course also uses a coherent content storyline approach (Roth et al. 2011), and will engage the teachers in investigations using authentic data within the Claims Evidence Reasoning framework (McNeill & Krajcik 2012). The course theme will be exploring exoplanets in order to show how these objects have forced us to reconsider some ideas in our model for the formation of the Solar System, which is a disciplinary core idea identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (citation).

Ruch,Sessioned,University of St. Thomas,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Every semester the Physics Department at the University of St. Thomas has the Physics 104 class complete a Jupiter lab. This involves taking around twenty images of Jupiter and its moons with the telescope at the University of St. Thomas Observatory over the course of a few nights. The students then take each image and find the distance from each moon to Jupiter and plot the distances versus the elapsed time for the corresponding image. Students use the plot to fit four sinusoidal curves of the moons of Jupiter. I created a script that automates this process for the professor. It takes the list of images and creates a region file used by the students to measure the distance from the moons to Jupiter, a png image that is the graph of all the data points and the fitted curves of the four moons, and a csv file that contains the list of images, the date and time each image was taken, the elapsed time since the first image, and the distances to Jupiter for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. This is important because it lets the professor spend more time working with the students and answering questions as opposed to spending time fitting the curves of the moons on the graph, which can be time consuming.\n",11,

McCrady*,N. McCrady*; E. L. Rice,Sessioned,University of Montana; CUNY College of Staten Island; American Museum of Natural History,"Abstract Body: Astronomy 101 students are typically non-science majors fulfilling a general education requirement in the physical sciences. Many schools require that students complete a lab component with the course in order to meet the graduation requirement. The introductory astronomy course curriculum varies widely between instructors, and as such there is no agreed-upon standard set of topics or skills for lab activities. This is very challenging for the busy, heavily-loaded faculty member who needs a range of lab activities for their students. We have developed a collection of 40 concept-oriented activities for Astro 101 lab courses across a wide range of topics. The labs are designed to develop foundational skills and deep conceptual understanding in a hands-on, collaborative, learner-centered environment. They emphasize simple, inexpensive equipment to focus attention on key concepts rather than complicated apparatus, and to ease implementation for instructors working with limited resources. Instructors select only those labs that match their own course content, sequence the topics to align with their curriculum, and provide a fully custom lab manual to their students. Students, in turn, need only pay for labs they will use, keeping the materials affordable. On the web, see mccradyricelabs.com for more information.\n",13,

As a solution to this problem small group observing projects are incorporated into a 40 student introductory astronomy class composed primarily of non-science majors.  Students may choose from 8 observing projects such as graphing the motion of the moon or a planet, measuring daily and seasonal motions of stars, and determining the rotation rate of the Sun from sunspots.   Each group completes two projects, requiring the students to spend several hours outside of class making astronomical observations.  Clear instructions and a check-list style observing log help students with minimal observing experience to take accurate data without direct instructor assistance.  Students report their findings in a lab report-style paper, as well as in a formal oral or poster presentation.  The projects serve a double purpose of allowing students to directly experience concepts covered in class as well as providing students with experience collecting, analyzing, and presenting astronomical data.\n",15,

The observed linear relationship between these quantities is similar to the local starburst relation. We derive a selective attenuation curve over the range 1250 Å < λ < 8320 Å and find that a single attenuation curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample.

Dust is commonly used as a tracer for cold dense gas, either through IR and NIR emission maps or through extinction mapping. Extinction mapping has been used to trace dust column densities in the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, and M31. The maps for M31 use IR and NIR photometry of red giant branch stars, which is more difficult to obtain for more distant galaxies. Our method uses the extinctions derived for individual massive stars using the isochrone-matching method described by Kim et al. (2012). With our 5-band photometry, which extends into the UV, we are able to trace even small amounts of extinction. These maps are then compared to HI and CO maps of the same galaxies with the goal of constraining the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which we can then correlate with the gas phase metallicity from other observations. This poster will demonstrate the technique on a few galaxies, but the project will subsequently be expanded to cover the full LEGUS sample of nearly 50 galaxies. These maps can then be used to correct massive star and cluster photometry and HII region Halpha observations for the effects of extinction in order to better characterize star formation rates and massive stellar populations for other projects, such as initial mass function studies and ionization balance studies for HII regions and the diffuse ionized gas.\n",2,

With the emergence of powerful facilities and instruments in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths, which complement data from infrared space telescopes like Herschel, scientists have been able to observe the infrared SEDs of faraway galaxies (with redshifts between 2 and 5). These SEDs are being used to derive both star formation rates (SFR) and dust masses, the latter related to gas masses. The relationship between SFRs and gas masses determine the fundamental scaling laws of star formation (the Schmidt Kennicutt Law). Thus, it is fundamental to ascertain whether derivation of these quantities from IR SEDs may be affected by covariance.

Detailed studies of the dust extinction curve and its variation have hithertofore been largely limited to samples of hundreds of specially chosen stars. We use spectroscopy from APOGEE in combination with photometry from Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to characterize the dust extinction curve throughout much of the nearest few kiloparsecs of the Galactic plane using tens of thousands of stars. We make new measurements of the dust extinction curve and its variation, finding that the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of curves, described, for instance, by <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>). Our data show little evidence of any need for further parameters. The local curvature of the extinction curve increases with decreasing <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>) throughout most of the optical and infrared: the extinction curve in the infrared is not more ``universal'' than in the optical, in contrast to several widely-used extinction curve parameterizations. We find that the shape of the dust extinction curve is rather uniform, with <i>σ</i>(<i>R</i>(<i>V</i>)) = 0.2, and with less than two percent of sight lines having <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>) > 4. However, significant spatially coherent variations in <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>) do exist. The primary variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds, indicating that grain growth in dense molecular cloud environments is not the primary driver of <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>) variations in dust at large. Indeed, we find no correlation between <i>R</i>(<i>V</i>) and dust column density out to <i>E</i>(<i>B-V</i>) ≈ 2.\n",9,

We derive the extinction due to dust using fits to the stellar locus of stars brighter than g=21 in color-color diagrams, and explore the spatial distribution of the extinction within each of the fields. We compare our results to the extinction map of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998), and find generally good agreement. We describe plans to measure the three-dimensional distribution of extinction in these fields using fainter stars and background galaxies as tracers.

Minor, Edward Guinan, Richard Wasatonic<br />            Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) is a large, luminous semi-regular red supergiant of spectral class M1.5-2Iab. It is the 8<sup>th</sup> brightest star in the night sky. Betelgeuse is 30,000 times more luminous than the Sun and 700 times larger. It has an estimated age of ~8 +/- 2 Myr. Betelgeuse explode in a Type II supernova (anytime within the next million years). When it explodes, it will shine with about the intensity of a full moon and may be visible during the day. However, it is too far away to cause any major damage to Earth.<br />            Photometry of this pre-supernova star has been ongoing at Villanova for nearly 45 years. These observations are being used to define the complex brightness variations of this star. Semi-regular periodic light variations have been found with periods of 385 days up to many years. These light variations are used to study its unstable atmosphere and resulting complex pulsations. Over the last 15 years, it has been observed by Wasatonic who has accumulated a large photometric database.<br />            The ground-based observations are limited to precisions of 1.5%, and due to poor weather, limit observations to about 1-2 times per week. However, with the recent successful launch of the BRITE Nano-satellites (http://www.brite-constellation.at) during 2013-14, it is possible to secure high precision photometry of bright stars, including Betelgeuse, continuously for up to 3 months. Villanova has participated in the BRITE guest investigators program and has been awarded observing time and data rights many bright stars, including Betelgeuse. BRITE blue and red observations of Betelgeuse were carried out during the Nov-Feb 2013-14 season and the 2014-15. These datasets were given to Villanova and have been combined with coexistent photometry from Wasatonic. Although BRITE’s red data is saturated, the blue data is useable. The BRITE datasets were combined with our ground-based V, red, and near-IR photometry. Problems were uncovered with the some of the BRITE data, but they were resolved for the most part. We present and discuss the results obtained so far.\n",1,

In 2012, we searched a list of 480 galactic AGB stars and found a total of 13 targeted or serendipitous observations with few detections (Ramstedt et al. 2012). Since this initial search new programs have successfully targeted and detected X-ray emission from a handful of AGB stars. The X-ray emission, when detected, reveals high temperature plasma (>= 10 MK). This plasma might be heated by a large-scale magnetic field or indicate the presence of accretion onto a compact companion. In this poster, we update our search for X-ray emission from AGB stars with a review of their characteristics, potential origins, and impact of X-ray emission in this late stage of stellar evolution.\n",2,

Humphreys*,Sessioned,Univ. of Minnesota,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The most massive cool stars near the empircal upper limit of luminosity on the HR Diagram shed mass during brief, intense periods of enhanced mass loss. Their circumstellar environments show extensive and complex ejecta in scattered light at visual wavelengths. In the infrared, thermal emission from cooler dust in their ejecta can be used as a tracers of their mass loss histories. We combine high-resolution adaptive optics imaging from MMT/MIRAC (8 - 12 µm) with the new capabilities in far-infrared imaging of SOFIA/FORCAST and Herschel/PACS to probe further into the past for evidence of earlier mass loss for four famous objects: the red supergiants mu Cep and VY CMa and the yellow hypergiants IRC +10420 and rho Cas. We find evidence for a variable mass loss rate over several thousand years for mu Cep, while in contrast the lack of extended cold dust beyond VY CMa's visible ejecta indicates that its high mass loss episodes are recent. Despite its history of episodic mass loss, rho Cas has no resolved circumstellar ejecta. The new long wavelength photometry from FORCAST, however, confirms the presence of a slowly expanding dust shell from its 1946 event\n",3,

A. Evans*,K. A. Evans*; P. Massey,Sessioned,California Institute of Technology; Lowell Observatory; Northern Arizona University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): A significant percentage of OB stars are runaways, so we should expect a similar percentage of their evolved descendants to also be runaways. However, recognizing such stars presents its own set of challenges, as these older, more evolved stars will have drifted further from their birthplace, and thus their velocities might not be obviously peculiar. Several Galactic red supergiants (RSGs) have been described as likely runaways, based upon the existence of bow shocks, including Betelgeuse. Here we announce the discovery of a runaway RSG in M31, based upon a 300 km s<sup>-1</sup> discrepancy with M31's kinematics. The star is found about 21′ (4.6 kpc) from the plane of the disk, but this separation is consistent with its velocity and likely age (∼10 Myr). The star, J004330.06+405258.4, is an M2 I, with M<sub>V</sub>=-5.7, log L/L<sub>⊙</sub>=4.76, an effective temperature of 3700 K, and an inferred mass of 12-15 M<sub>⊙</sub>. The star may be a high-mass analog of the hypervelocity stars, given that its peculiar space velocity is probably 400-450 km s<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to the escape speed from M31's disk. K. A.

V. Dixon*,W. V. Dixon*; P. Chayer; R. A. Benjamin,Sessioned,"Space Telescope Science Institute; University of Wisconsin, Whitewater","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Post-AGB stars represent a short-lived phase of stellar evolution during which stars cross the optical color-magnitude diagram from the cool, red tip of the assymptotic giant branch (AGB) to the hot, blue tip of the white-dwarf cooling curve. Their surface chemistry reflects the nuclear-shell burning, mixing, and mass-loss processes characteristic of AGB stars, and their high effective temperatures allow the detection of elements that are unobservable in cool giants. Post-AGB stars in globular clusters offer the additional advantages of known distance, age, and initial chemistry. To better understand the AGB evolution of low-mass stars, we have observed the post-AGB star Y453 in the globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121) with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The star, which has an effective temperature of at least 60,000 K, shows absorption from He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, S, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga. While the star's C and O abundances are consistent with those measured in a sample of nitrogen-poor RGB stars in M4, its N abundance is considerably enhanced. The star's low C abundance suggests that it left the AGB before the onset of third dredge-up.<br />This work was supported by NASA grant HST-GO-13721.001-A to the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater.

Most targets were observed twice for 2-5 minutes at each of three frequencies (C, X, and K-bands), although a few targets were also observed at a fourth frequency (Q-band). 22 of the 129 MCVS were detected at one or more frequencies. Of these 22 detections, 15 are new. This number nearly triples the number of MCVs that are known radio sources. Most detections are at the C and X-band frequencies, although three sources were detected at the K-band frequency. One of the K-band frequency detections is the known rapidly-rotating radio source AE Aqr, while the other two are the polars, AI Tri and ST LMi. Of the 22 detected sources, two-thirds are polars (15) and all are believed to be nearby (<200 pc). Except for a few stronger sources, most detections are in the range of 100-200 µJy, which at a distance of 150 pc corresponds roughly to a luminosity of 2x10<sup>24</sup> erg/s at the X-band frequency. The results of this survey are encouraging in that more MCVs are likely to be detected as the time on-source increases, since the flux from MCVs is highly variable.\n",6,

E. Harrison*,T. E. Harrison*; B. McArthur,Sessioned,New Mexico State Univ.; University of Texas,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recently, our results for the HST FGS parallax of SS Cyg (Harrison et al. 2000) have been called into question due to a recent radio parallax for this object (Miller-Jones et al. 2013). We have re-analyzed the data for our FGS program on SS Cyg and derive a revised parallax of 7.3 +/- 0.2 mas (137 pc). This parallax is 17% larger than that originally published. We discuss the new analysis effort, and the reasons for the change in our result. We believe we have identified why the radio parallax (8.77 mas) disagrees with the FGS results: We find that if we allow for a roll of two degrees in the HST coordinate system, we obtain the discrepant VLBA radio parallax. It is impossible, however, for the error in the roll of HST to be more than a few tenths of a degree, or else the FGS would not lock-on to the program targets. This roll leads to the large, and erroneous VLBA parallax for SS Cyg. We note that the radio parallax for the black hole system V404 Cyg (Miller-Jones et al. 2009) is also much larger than the spectroscopic parallax of its secondary star. In addition, we closely examine the attempt by Nelan & Bond (2013) to reconcile the FGS data set with the radio result. We identify what we believe to be significant issues with their analysis. Finally, we present a quantitative abundance analysis for SS Cyg, RU Peg, and GK Per derived from moderate resolution K-band spectroscopy. We find severe carbon deficiencies (10 to 20% of the solar value) in the secondary stars of all three objects. We describe the Python program ""kmoog"" which generates synthetic spectra, and autonomously compares them to observational data.<br />\n",7,

All three systems appear to be accreting at high rates long after their novae. They exhibit continua that are steeply rising into the FUV as well as absorption lines and emission lines of uncertain origin. All three have FUSE spectra which offer not only higher spectral resolution but also wavelength coverage extending down to the Lyman Limit. We have matched these FUSE spectra with existing archival HST STIS and IUE spectral coverage, and adopted the newly determined interstellar reddening corrections of Selvelli and Gilmozzi (2013). The dereddened FUV spectra have been modeled with our grids of optically thick accretion disks and hot white dwarf photospheres.

V339 Del was discovered on 2015 August 14.58 by Itagaki at V about 6.8. This nova reached a peak magnitude of about 4.3 making it one of the brightest novae of this century. Because of its exceptional brightness it has been observed at a variety of wavelengths and by a host of observatories both on the ground and in space. V5668 Sgr was discovered on 2015 March 15.634 by Seach at a magnitude of 6.0. It subsequently reached a maximum brightness of about 4.0 in late March. High resolution PEPSI spectra obtained in early April show dramatic variations in the multi-component P Cygni-type line profiles.

Garnavich,Sessioned,University of Texas at Austin; Wesleyan University; University of Notre Dame,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy of the suspected polar MASTER OT J132104.04+560957.8 (J1321) taken at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) simultaneously with the LBC camera and MODS spectrograph in binocular mode. Our V-band photometry confirmed a primary and secondary maximum first identified by Littlefield et al. In the spectra we see unusually deep Balmer and helium absorption features for about 10-15% of a 91 minute orbital period. The absorption lines first appear to the red of the emission peaks then shift bluewards, ultimately dominating the line profile at zero radial velocity. Towards the end of the absorption phase, weak absorption reappears to the blue of the emission lines. When the system is bright the spectra show a broadly-peaked continuum with a maximum around 500nm. We do not see absorption during the secondary bright red phase. Around the minima the continuum is blue and resembles a more typical polar spectrum with strong Balmer, neutral helium and ionized helium emission lines. The Doppler tomograms of J1321 are fuzzy and blobby and resemble those of the asynchronous polar BY Cam. The highly variable width of the secondary maximum remains a mystery along with the lack of a discernible irradiated secondary in the tomograms. We use our observations to constrain the properties of the white dwarf's magnetic field as well as the accretion flow structure. We also discuss evidence of J1321 being in a prolonged low-mass-transfer state in all observations prior to 2007.\n",11,

Kojima on 2012 July 16.512 UT at a magnitude of ~12.6. A low-resolution spectrum obtained by M. Fujii on 2012 July 18.572 UT confirmed that the object was indeed a Classical Nova. The AAVSO V-band light curve showed that the nova peaked near 11th mag on July 23-24 UT and subsequently declined in brightness with a t_2 of about 27 days making it a moderately fast nova. We obtained optical spectroscopy of V5593 Sgr between 2012 July 26 and 2013 February 19 UT with the SMARTS/CTIO 1.5 m telescope (+RC spectrograph) and then between 2014 August 25 and 2015 June 17 UT using the MDM Observatory 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+CCDS), the 8.4 m Large Binocular Telescope (+MODS1), and the 6.5 m MMT (+BlueChannel). The SMARTS spectra confirmed the Fe II classification but showed that by 2013 February 19 UT the Fe II lines became much weaker and strong He II 468.5 nm and [Fe VII] 608.7 nm became prominent. A spectrum obtained on 2014 August 25 UT exhibited Balmer, He II, and [Fe VII] emission lines, but also for the first time, the presence of strong [Fe X] 637.4 nm emission with an observed intensity ratio with respect to Halpha of about 1.5. Other identified emission lines in our spectra included O VI, [Ca V], [Ca VI], [Ca VII], [Fe VI], [Fe XI], and [Fe XIV]. Surprisingly, [O III] emission was weak or absent. By 2015 June, a spectrum showed that the observed [Fe X]/Halpha intensity ratio had decreased to about 0.74. Contemporaneous optical photometry was obtained with the SMARTS/CTIO 1 m telescope (+ANDICAM) between 2014 March 19 and 2015 September 28 UT in the BVRIJHK bands. In agreement with our spectra in quiescence, V5593 Sgr is very red with (B-V) ~ 1 mag and (V-K) ~ 5 mag. The photometry shows ellipsoidal-like modulations with a peak-to-peak amplitude exceeding 2 mag in R and I. The modulation is seen in B through K; however, the amplitude is lower in JHK. Brief eclipses occur at the minimum of the ellipsoidal variation with a depth of at least 5 mag in R and I. The eclipse is seen in all bands covered by our observations. Two or more candidate periods may be consistent with the data. We will discuss these results in the context of other classical novae including GQ Mus and V723 Cas.<br />\n",12,

Observations such as disk tilt are found in all of these different accreting system types, suggesting a common physics must be present. To understand the common connections between these different system types, which can help us understand their unique evolutions, we need to better understand the physics of accretion. For example, viscosity is typically a constant value in the disk of a system that is in a specific state such as a quiescent state. However, viscosity can't be constant throughout the disk, especially at the boundaries. To learn more about viscosity and other common parameters in these disk, we use Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to make predictions of events to come in the numerical simulations of these accreting disks. In this work, we present our techniques and initial findings.\n",14,

We investigate the spiral structure in the X-ray surface brightness, which is a common signature of gas sloshing caused by an interaction with another nearby cluster. We identify discontinuities (edges) in the cluster surface brightness profiles in different directions from the cluster center. We measure the gas temperature, pressure and entropy across these surface brightness edges and find that the prominant surface brightness edges in the east and west are both typical “cold fronts”, likely produced by gas sloshing. We use the results of our analysis to constrain the strength of the magnetic field in the cluster. We also use our measurements to provide an upper limit on the velocity of the cold gas beneath the front surface of the cold front. Finally we identify two subcluster candidates in the cluster outskirts, which may have been responsible for the gas sloshing.<br /><br />This research was supported by the Smithsonian Institution, Chandra Prime Contract NAS8-03060, Nanjing University, and the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.\n",2,

Major cluster mergers leave distinct signatures in the ICM in the form of shocks, turbulence, and diffuse cluster radio sources. These diffuse radio sources, so-called radio relics and halos, provide evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles and the presence of large scale magnetic fields in the ICM. Observations of these halos and relics allow us to (i) study the physics of particle acceleration and its relation with shocks and turbulence in the ICM and (ii) constrain the dynamical evolution of the merger events<br /><br />We present Jansky Very Large Array 1-4 GHz observations of the Frontier cluster Abell 2744. We confirm the presence of the known giant radio halo and radio relic via our deep radio images. Owing to the much greater sensitivity of the JVLA compared to previous observations, we are able to detect a previously unobserved long Mpc-size filament of synchrotron emission to the south west of the cluster core. We also present a radio spectral index image of the diffuse cluster emission to test the origin of the radio relic and halo, related to the underlying particle acceleration mechanism. Finally, we carry out a search for radio emission from the 'jellyfish' galaxies in A2744 to estimate their star formation rate. These highly disturbed galaxies are likely influenced by the cluster merger event, although the precise origin of these galaxies is still being debated.\n",3,

The data was taken with the Wide-field Camera 3 (WFC3), and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These 25 clusters have also been observed in the mid-IR by Spitzer IRAC, the far-IR by the Herschel Space Observatory PACS and SPIRE, and in the x-ray by the Chandra and XMM observatories. We focused on the two brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the survey (MACS1931.8-2653 and RXJ1532.9+3021) that have reddening-corrected UV-derived star formation rates (SFRs) > 100 M<sub>⊙</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> as measured by Fogarty et al (2015). The inclusion of Herschel data provides unique constraints on dust content and independent estimates of the star formation rates in these interesting galaxies. We performed photometry on the five Herschel bands (100-500μm), and removed any contamination from other cluster members. We fit a UV-FIR SED to each galaxy to measure the bolometric dust luminosity (L<sub>bol</sub>), which we use to derive the FIR obscured SFR. We calculate the sum of the measured UV unobscured SFR from the HST photometry and the FIR obscured SFR from the Herschel photometry to get a total SFR for these two BCGs. We compared this to the reddening-corrected SFRs and found they were in agreement within error. This confirms that the Kennicutt and Calzetti methods for calculating star formation rates are both applicable for these highly star-forming massive cluster galaxies.\n",8,

Using this sample of massive halos we constrain the progenitor population and formation mechanism of the ICL by measuring the ICL surface brightness profile, the ICL color and color gradient, and the total ICL luminosity within 10<r [kpc]<110 kpc. We find that the vast majority of our groups and clusters show clear negative color gradients. Such negative colour (and equivalently, metallicity) gradients can arise from tidal stripping of L* galaxies and/or the disruption of dwarf galaxies, but not major mergers with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We also find ICL luminosities of 3–9 L* in the range 10 < r < 110 kpc for these clusters. Dwarf disruption alone cannot explain the total luminosity of the ICL and remain consistent with the observed evolution in the faint-end slope of the luminosity function. The results of our study are suggestive of a formation history in which the ICL is built-up by a combination of stripping of L* galaxies and/or dwarf disruption and disfavor significant contribution by major mergers with the BCG.<br /><br />This sample of groups and clusters is the largest with HST/WFC3 data for ICL analysis that spans two orders of magnitude in halo mass at redshifts >0.3.

We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) of Abell 133 and assess the extent to which uncertainties on background subtraction affect measured quantities. We implement two methods of analyzing the ICM spectra: one in which the blank-sky background is subtracted, and another in which the sky background is modeled. We find that the two methods are consistent within the 90% confidence ranges. We were able to measure the thermodynamic properties of the cluster up to R500.

Although it is a final product of galaxy evolution, it gives a clue to the processes that the galaxy suffer. Galaxy clusters are the sites where the most massive galaxies are found, and so the most dramatic merger histories are embedded. Our extra-ordinary deep (μ<sub>r</sub> ~ 28 mag/’’<sup>2</sup>) imaging of Abell 119 at z = 0.044 using a Blanco 4-m telescope at CTIO enable us to detect low surface brightness features, and we found post-merger signatures for 25% of red-sequence galaxies in the clusters suggesting that so many galaxies even in clusters have gone through galaxy mergers at recent epochs. We quantified the degree of peculiarity of morphology utilizing residual lights from model subtracted images to pin down the merger frequency in cluster environments more objectively. With our technique we measured the degree of features which in turn allow us to extract the details of the merger properties, such as the galaxy mass ratios and the merger frequency. We went further to understand the impact of galaxy mergers in cluster environment using the SAMI Integral Field Unit on the galaxies of Abell 119 and found that half of galaxies related to mergers show misalignment in the angle between the photometric major and the rotation axes, and most of them show complex kinematic features. Our research on quantification of merger features through deep imaging help us to understand the merger history of cluster galaxies, and we present our understanding of galaxy mergers in cluster environment from the perspective of kinematics.\n",11,

Zschaechner,Sessioned,Rutgers University; Max Planck Institut für Astronomie,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The highest-redshift quasars (z>6) host supermassive black holes (M<sub>BH</sub> > 1e9 M<sub>⊙</sub>) and presumably reside in massive host galaxies located in some of the largest galaxy overdensities at early cosmic epochs. However, optical searches for such overdensities have so far been inconclusive. One caveat is that the sources could be too faint in optical wavelengths, so while overdensities may be present, they must be detected at a longer wavelength regime. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) now provides the sensitivity and resolution required to detect and resolve faint sources at very high redshift (z>5-6). Instead of blind surveys, the data we present are observations of known bright quasars from the ALMA archive. Examining the sidelines of these quasars and comparing them with the number count of sources in blind surveys enables us to learn whether quasars are present in galaxy overdensities or if their environments are indistinguishable from a blank field. We use ALMA cycle 0, 1 and 2 data to map the vicinity of ten quasars at z>6 in the continuum at ~1.2mm, tracing the far infrared dust emission, to perform an independent search for companions around the quasars. We also examine the presence of the [CII] line in these fields. We compare the number density of such sources to ‘blank field’ studies to see if there is evidence for an overdensity of sources in the immediate vicinity of the quasars. Either outcome (‘overdensity’ or ‘no overdensity’) would have important implications for early structure formation. Preliminary results show there is an excess of positive flux in these fields, and there is a total of a few (<10) +5σ detections in the ten fields, but further work to estimate the number of spurious detections is necessary.\n",12,

Xiao,Sessioned,University of Virginia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Galaxy interactions are critical to the evolution of the universe, influencing everything from star formation to the structure of the known universe. By studying galaxy interactions through computer simulations, we are able to observe what would normally take billions of years to progress. Compact groups are extremely dense clusters of at least three and typically no more than 10 galaxies interacting gravitationally that will often merge. These groups yield considerable information about galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments but are difficult to observe at high redshifts. The Millennium Simulation is a massive n-body simulation of cold dark matter particles on a time scale equivalent to the known universe. It solves this problem as it allows us to study high redshift objects and timescales of billions of years. Using the simulation and what we know about compact groups from the Hickson surveys, we were able to examine the evolution of these groups through cosmic time. We built an algorithm that analyzed galaxies in the Millennium Simulation and tuned it to various selection parameters. We found that roughly 7% of galaxies in the present day were once compact groups, as most groups merged into a single elliptical galaxy. There is also an epoch of group existence at z ~ 1.5, slightly after the well-known epoch of star formation at z ~ 2. This offset provides meaningful insight into the evolution of compact groups and the influence they have had on the universe we see today.<br />\n",13,

They are typically associated with the luminous central galaxy within the cluster and often appear bent due to interaction with the hot, X-ray bright intracluster medium (ICM). Their linear extent (r > 100 kpc) and radio luminosity make them good tracers of high redshift systems where X-ray and optical observations are more difficult. In an effort to characterize the global X-ray properties of WAT clusters, we have assembled a sample of WAT systems from the Chandra archive. We have examined the distribution of substructure, temperature, abundance, density and pressure within the ICM. We find the majority of WAT clusters display some merger signatures and many show evidence of cool/high metallicity gas within 100 kpc of the WAT host galaxy. Most notably, we observe that clusters with the highest central densities and pressures host WATs with the shortest flare radii.\n",14,

Johnson*,L. Johnson*; J. Irwin; R. E. White,Sessioned,University of Alabama,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Fossil galaxy systems are thought to be the end result of group evolution, as galaxies experiencing dynamical friction sink to the center of the group potential and merge into a single elliptical that dominates the rest of the members in both mass and luminosity. However, two alternate formation mechanisms are possible: a group merger scenario where two smaller group BGG’s merge into one large elliptical which then promotes the final group to fossil status or the group being initially ""born that way."" The group merger mechanism could explain why some fossils exhibit cool cores while others do not, as gas cooling timescales are significantly longer than galaxy merging timescales. Most fossil systems discovered lie within z<0.2, which begs the question: what did these systems look like in the past, and which formation process did they undergo? Such progenitors are expected to be systems with imminent or ongoing major mergers that will transition into fossil status before z=0. The group merger scenario (particularly along the line-of-sight), or even simply the dominance of the fossil BGG, suggests a highly concentrated system ideal for strong gravitational lensing. Strong lensing events also preferentially pick out merging systems which makes this an ideal selection criteria for our study. We use the CASSOWARY survey of strong lensing events as our sample with the goal of determining if lensing systems have a predisposition of being fossil systems or progenitors. We present a catalog of fossil progenitor candidates from the CASSOWARY survey with redshifts ranging from 0.1<z<0.7. We find that 50% of these lensing groups are either fossils or fossil progenitors, suggesting that searching for stong lensing events may be a more efficient way of finding fossil and pre-fossil systems.\n",15,

From these two pieces of information, we measure the size and total dynamical mass of each cluster. We can combine this calculation with other measurements of mass of the same galaxy clusters (like measurements from strong lensing or X-ray) to determine the spatial distribution of luminous and dark matter out to the virial radius of the cluster.\n",16,

The candidates come from the Spitzer/Hetdex Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) survey with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and allow us to probe clusters at higher redshift than typical with optically-selected samples, with objects less massive than those typical with SZ surveys. Our sample contains 45 cluster candidates---overdensities identified using photometric redshifts of the member galaxies. The cluster candidates have 24-35 visible members, and were not individually detected in SZ by ACT. In the stacking analysis, ACT measurements show a temperature decrement at 148 GHz, but an excess at the 220 GHz SZ null, which we attribute to dust emission from the cluster galaxies. To correct the decrement for dust contamination we use two methods to determine the dust spectral energy distribution (SED). First we use the correlation in the CIB power spectra observed by Planck at 143 and 217 GHz. Second, we use catalog sources from the Herschel Stripe 82 (HerS) survey, combining the emission from all sources proximate to our sample at 600, 860, and 1200 GHz, and fitting a graybody spectrum. Both methods yield a similar dust SED from 220 GHz to 148 GHz, and we use this to extrapolate the 220 GHz increment and estimate the 148 GHz contamination. After the dust correction, we use the universal pressure profile to fit for an average SZ signal and cluster mass.\n",17,

Scaffolding is especially important for distance-learning programs and computer-based learning environments.  Preliminary studies are showing that when students learn about complex topics within computer-based learning environments without scaffolding, they fail to gain a conceptual understanding of the topic. As a result, researchers have begun to emphasize the importance of scaffolding for web-based as well as in-person instruction.<br /><br />To support scaffolded teaching practices and techniques, while addressing the needs of life-long learners, we have created the Cosmic Concepts video series.  The series consists of short, one-topic videos that address scientific concepts with a special emphasis on those that traditionally cause confusion or are layered with misconceptions. Each video focuses on one idea at a time and provides a clear explanation of phenomena that is succinct enough for on-demand reference usage by all types of learners. Likewise, the videos can be used by educators to scaffold the scientific concepts behind astronomical images, or can be sequenced together to create well-structured pathways for presenting deeper and more layered ideas.  This approach is critical for communicating information about astronomical discoveries that are often dense with unfamiliar concepts, complex ideas, and highly technical details. Additionally, learning tools in video formats support multi-sensory presentation approaches that can make astronomy more accessible to a variety of learners. <br />\n",1,

Gorjian,Sessioned,Notre Dame High School; Glencoe High School; Ridgway Christian High School; Willmar Senior High School; JPL/Caltech,"Abstract Body: The NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) uses authentic astronomical research to bring the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) into the classroom. The creation of the NGSS was a collaborative effort between teams composed of teachers, scientists and other professionals from twenty-six states. These standards provide a framework for the change in how science is taught at all levels from kindergarten to twelfth grade in participating states. Scientific concepts are grouped into broad categories (physical, biological and earth sciences), and call for an interdisciplinary approach to content, along with the integration of engineering practices into the curriculum. This approach to the teaching of science has led educators to place more emphasis on authentic learning and problem-solving in their curricula. Project-based learning is a strategy that can effectively allow students to learn core scientific concepts within the context of a focused and complex scientific problem.<br /><br />The NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) pairs teams of teachers and students with NASA astronomers. These teams are immersed in an astronomy research project over the course of the year, and are responsible for writing a project proposal, doing original research and presenting that research at a professional conference. The students who are involved in the NITARP research are provided with a rich hands-on experience that both exposes them to a deep understanding of an astronomical problem (and the core physics and math behind it), as well as the process of doing real science. The NITARP program offers a unique opportunity to bring project-based learning into K-12 science classrooms. We will highlight the ways in which this program has been implemented in classrooms across the country, as well as the connections to the NGSS.<br /><br />This research was made possible through the NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) and was funded by NASA Astrophysics Data Program.\n",3,

These lesson plans vary in topic from environmental science to neurobiology to astrophysics, and involve a range of activities from laboratory exercises to art projects, debates, or group discussion. An integral component of the program is a series of short, ""bite-size"" articles on modern science research written for K-12 students. The ""bite-size"" articles and lesson plans will be made freely available online in an easily searchable web interface that includes association with a variety of curriculum standards. This ongoing program is in its first year with about 15 lesson plans produced to date.<br />\n",4,

While the main focus of the program is aimed at giving educators experience working with and publishing scientific research, teachers are encouraged to involve students with the experience. NITARP funds up to two students to travel along with the educator while allowing an additional two students to attend but with no additional financial assistance. Teachers are welcome to have more student participants but no more than 4 may travel with the teacher to Caltech and the AAS meeting. Given that the focus of the NITARP program is on the educators, little is known about the effects of the program on the student participants other than anecdotal evidence. In order to better understand the impact on the students, we have designed a survey to be administered to past student participants. The survey was constructed with a goal to determine if the NITARP experience had an impact on students’ views of science and influenced their educational paths. While the NITARP project has assembled some evidence of the impact on students, this is the first formal attempt to capture that impact. This poster will present the results of that survey.\n",5,

With that dissemination comes the challenge of reaching and motivating a population that is more diverse in their academic abilities and intrinsic motivation. The abstract nature of pure physics is often made more accessible when motivated by examples from everyday life, and providing copious mathematical as well as conceptual examples has become standard practice in high school physics textbooks. Astronomy is a naturally captivating subject and astronomical examples are often successful in capturing the curiosity of high school students as well as the general population. This project seeks to diversify the range of pedagogical materials available to the high school physics instructor by compiling and publishing specific examples where an astronomical concept can be used to motivate the physics curriculum. This collection of examples will consist of both short problems suitable for daily homework assignments as well as longer project style activities.  <br /><br />Collaborations are encouraged and inquiries should be directed to sdieterich at carnegiescience dot edu.<br /><br />This work is funded by the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship Program through NSF grant AST-1400680.\n",6,

Our partner school is located in Les Cayes, Haiti a city where only 65% of children attend school, and only half of those will complete 6th grade. Astronomy provides an accessible and non-intimidating entry into science, and activity-based learning contrasts with the predominant traditional teaching techniques in use in Haiti, to reach and inspire a different cohort of learners. Teachers are predominantly women in Haiti, so part of the effort involves connecting them with scientists, engineers and teacher peers in the US. As a developing nation, it is vital for Haitian (as for all) children to grow up viewing women as leaders in science. Meanwhile in the US, few are aware of the reality of getting an education in a 3rd world nation (i.e. most of the world), so we also joined with teachers in Massachusetts to give US school children a peek at what daily life is like for their peers living in our vibrant but impoverished neighbor. Our Haitian partners are committed to helping their sister-schools with curriculum and educator workshops, so that the overall quality of education can rise, and not be limited to the very few schools with access to resources.

Two main barriers include: (1) insufficient corpus of American Sign Language (ASL) for astronomy terminology, and (2) DHH education professionals who lack astronomy background. A suite of vocabulary, accessible hands-on activities, and interaction with trained professionals, are critical for enhancing the background experiences of DHH youth, as they may come to an astronomy lesson lacking the basic “incidental learning” that is often taken for granted with hearing peers (for example, from astronomy in the media).<br /><br />A collaboration between the Skynet Junior Scholars (SJS) project and the Wisconsin School for the Deaf is bringing astronomy to the DHH community in an accessible way for the first time. We follow a group of seven DHH youth over one semester as they interact with the SJS tools and curriculum to understand how they assimilate astronomy experiences and benefit from access to telescopes both directly (on school campus and at Yerkes Observatory) and through Skynet’s robotic telescope network (optical and radio telescopes, inquiry-based modules, data analysis tools, and professional astronomers).

This work will evaluate the use of phosphor image plates and deuterium lamps as an intensity calibration method for the Ni V spectrum in the 1200-1600Å region of the VUV.

Townley-Smith*,K. Townley-Smith*; G. Nave,Sessioned,Lamar University; National Institute of Standards and Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): There is an on-going project in the Atomic Spectroscopy Group at NIST to obtain comprehensive spectral data for all of the singly ionized iron group elements and acquire more accurate energy levels, wavelengths and hyperfine structure (HFS) constants. The heavy abundance of the iron group elements and their contributions to a wide range of stellar spectra makes them of interest for astrophysical observations.<br /><br />Existing spectroscopic data for Mn are insufficient to model spectra obtained from HgMn stars such as HD 175640. Since manganese has an odd number of nucleons, its spectral lines generally exhibit HFS, a relativistic effect due to interaction between the magnetic moment of the nucleus and the orbiting electrons. If proper treatment of line broadening effects such as HFS is not taken, there is a poor fit of the lines in stellar spectra, leading to an overestimate of the abundance of Mn. The abnormally high abundance of manganese in HgMn stars means both weak and strong transitions are important. Weak lines may not be observed in the laboratory, but HFS constants for them can be derived from stronger transitions that combine with the two levels involved in the weak transition.<br /><br />Holt et al. (1999) measured HFS constants for 56 energy levels using laser spectroscopy. We have analyzed Fourier Transform spectra of a high current Mn/Ni hollow cathode lamp to obtain magnetic dipole A constants levels of Mn II. The A constants of Holt et al.

Zhang*,Z. Zhang*; P. C. Stancil,Sessioned,The University of Georgia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): SiO emission lines are important probes of chemical processes in diverse astrophysical environments. In circumstellar outflows of AGB stars, the production of silicate grains is preceded by SiO formation, making SiO a useful measure of Si depletion. SiO is also commonly observed in shocks associated with the outflows of young stellar objects, both low- and high-mass. To model SiO emission for non-LTE conditions requires collisional rate coefficients due to H<sub>2</sub> impact which are currently unavailable. Unknown collisional rate coefficients are often estimated from known systems. For the case of SiO-H<sub>2</sub>, rate coefficients have previously been adapted from a different collider, He (Dayau & Balanca 2006), based on a reduced-mass scaling approach. Recently it has been suggested that scaling via the interaction potential well depth and the reduced masses of the collisional systems may be more reliable (Walker et al. 2014). Using the non-LTE spectral modeling package Radex (van der Tak et al. 2007), we construct diagnostic plots of SiO line ratios using SiO-H<sub>2</sub> collisional rate coefficients based on (i) reduced-mass scaling from the LAMDA database, (ii) potential well-depth scaling, and (iii) a more comprehensive input with multiple colliders (H<sub>2</sub>, He and H). Our goal is to give a more rigorous approach to SiO line emission simulations to better understand Si chemistry, dust formation/destruction, and other astrophysical processes.<br />This work was supported by NASA ATP grant NNX15AI61G.\n",8,

Cowan,Sessioned,University of Wisconsin; University of Texas; University of Oklahoma,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): New emission branching fraction measurements for 898 lines of the first spectrum of cobalt (Co I) from hollow cathode lamp spectra recorded with a 1m Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and a high resolution echelle spectrometer are reported. Radiative lifetimes from laser induced fluorescence measurements are combined with the branching fractions to determine accurate log(gf)s for the 898 lines. Selected published hyperfine structure (hfs) constants for levels of neutral Co are used to generate complete hfs component patterns for 195 transitions of Co I. These new laboratory data are applied to determine the Co abundance in the Sun and metal-poor star HD 84937, yielding log eps(Co) = 4.955 ± 0.007 (sigma = 0.059) based on 82 Co I lines and log eps(Co) = 2.785 ± 0.008 (sigma = 0.065) based on 66 Co I lines respectively. A Saha balance test on the photosphere of HD 84937 is performed using 16 UV lines of Co II, and good agreement is found with the Co I result in this metal-poor ([Fe I /H] = -2.32, [Fe II /H] = -2.32) dwarf star. The resulting value of [Co/Fe] = +0.14 supports a rise of Co/Fe at low metallicity that has been suggested in other studies. These new Co I data are part of a continuing effort to explore the limits of 1D/LTE photospheric models in metal-poor stars and to determine the relative abundance of Fe-group elements at low metallicity.

In plasmas with low electron temperatures, the dielectronic recombination (DR) rates for a range of ions can be very sensitive to near-threshold resonances and as a result there are large discrepancies in current DR databases. Recently the mechanism of below threshold recombination was proposed [1]. It was found that including below threshold resonances in the DR calculation can eliminate the hyper sensitivity of the rate coefficients to resonance positions. In this work, we first identify which ions have near threshold resonances in the Li-like and Be-like sequences. Three problematic ions (C<sup>3+</sup>, O<sup>4+</sup>, and Mg<sup>8+</sup>) were investigated and their DR rates recalculated to include below-threshold resonances. A search has also been performed for spectral evidence of this mechanism. The new DR rates can be used to calculate in modeling for low temperature plasmas.<br />[1] F. Robicheax, S. D. Loch, M. S.

These are propagated through a collisional-radiative model to produce uncertainties on the well know G and R-ratios for a He-like system.

However, the existing SA astronomical community is almost entirely white. The lack of black scientists (80% of SA population is black) is obviously one of the many legacies of apartheid and a major initiative was required to rectify the situation. The National Astrophysics and Space Science Program (NASSP) is aimed at ensuring the development of high level physics skills within SA, and specifically takes graduates with bachelor’s degrees in math or the physical sciences and prepares them to do PhDs in astrophysics and related disciplines. However, in 2003 when NASSP was established, there were no black SA astronomers, who could act as role models and mentors. This jeopardized the chances of success of NASSP and with it astronomy in SA. An American organization, the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) received a $355,000 grant from the WK Kellogg Foundation to increase the number of black SA astronomers. It enabled African American scientists - both professionals and students - to participate in NASSP. The African American professionals taught NASSP courses and acted as role models and mentors. The project was an overwhelming success.  From its beginning in 2003, the NASSP honors program graduates have gone on to a Master’s or PhD program at a rate of 60% (USA rate: 35%). American participation started in 2008.  In the very next year the number of black students jumped dramatically, reaching 80% in 2013 and this level continued in 2010-2014.  We believe this increase and its maintenance is in large part due to bringing black SA students from SA historically black colleges for two weeks to expose them to astronomy, to a one year program to allow them to catch up academically and to the mentoring activities of the members of NSBP. <br />\n",6,

This online catalog of variable stars is the repository of data on over 334,000 variable stars, including information on spectral type, range of magnitude, period, and type of variable, among other properties. A number of these stars were identified as being variable through automated telescope surveys, such as ASAS (All Sky Automated Survey). The computer code of this survey classified newly discovered variables as best it could, but a significant number of false classifications have been noted. The reclassification of ASAS variables in the VSX data, as well as a closer look at variables identified as miscellaneous type in VSX, are two of many projects that can be undertaken by interested undergraduates. In doing so, students learn about the physical properties of various types of variable stars as well as statistical analysis and computer software, especially the VStar variable star data visualization and analysis tool that is available to the astronomical community free of charge on the AAVSO website (https://www.aavso.org/vstar-overview). Two such projects are described in this presentation, the first to identify BY Draconis variables erroneously classified as Cepheids in ASAS data, and the second to identify SRD semiregular variables misidentified as “miscellaneous” in VSX.<br />\n",8,

Its historic deficiency of women and racial minorities has helped to keep it on a outwardly unreachable pedestal far higher than the public’s reach. One way we can pull science out its stiff academic walls is to incorporate it into an artistic performance. I have produced a multi-disciplinary performance event, called “The View From Nowhere”, which combined dance, physics and philosophy, all in one evening. The event is part of a long-term series which will attempt to translate scientific concepts into a diverse range of works by international choreographers. Because of the success of this series, both in the public feedback as well as in the amount of educational baggage acquired by the participants, I analyzed the structure of my own event and compared it to other existing ones to generate a model for multidisciplinary collaborations between the arts and the sciences. I will present a general structure for building collaborations between artists and scientists, more specifically in the context of visual, sound and performance art. From outlining the psychological aspects of human learning and their relationship with science communication, to discussing the potential of art as educational medium, I will discuss how science-inspired performances along with a pedagogy of the topic by a scientist allows a wider pool of people to have access to topics which are normally difficult to grasp in a traditional academic context. I will also be presenting the outline of a current APS-funded, long-term project which aims to build artistic collaborations between researchers in fluid dynamics from NYU, Georgia Tech, and University of Maryland and international artists which will result in an exhibit on the topic of quantum fluids at the New York City art venue Pioneer Works.\n",1,

AoT events feature several short astronomy-related presentations primarily by local professional scientists, but also by visiting scientists, students, educators, amatuer astronomers, writers, and artists. Events are held in social venues (bars, coffee shops, art galleries, etc.) in order to bring science directly to the public in a relaxed, informal atmosphere. With this we hope to engage a more diverse audience than typical lectures at academic and cultural institutions and to develop enthusiasm for science among voting, tax-paying adults. The flexible format and content of an AoT event is easy to adapt and expand based on the priorities, resources, and interests of local organizers. The social nature of AoT events provides important professional development and networking opportunities in science communication.

The WRO has recently received funding to upgrade the PlaneWave CDK 24-inch Corrected Dall-Kirkham Astrograph telescope. Recent additions to the telescope include an all-new Apogee Alta F16 CCD camera complete with a filter wheel (with narrowband and broadband filters) and a Minor Planet Center Observatory Code (W22). These new upgrades have allowed Astrophysics students to conduct unique research ranging from high precision minor planet astrometry, to broad- and narrow-band imaging of nebulae, to light curve analysis for variable star photometry. These new endeavours, in conjunction with an existing suite of Solar telescopes, gives the WRO the ability to live-stream solar and night-time observing. These streams are available both online and through interactive displays at the CCSSC making the WRO an educational outreach program for a worldwide public audience and a growing astronomical community.<br />Current funding is allowing students to get even more research experience than previously attainable further enabling the expansion of our publicly available gallery of nebula and galaxy images. Support and funding for the acquirement,installation, and upgrading of the new PlaneWave CDK24 has been provided by the International Museum and Library Services via the Museums for America Award Additionally, individual NASA Space Grant Scholarships have helped to secure a number of student interns partially responsible for recent improvements.\n",4,

Slater*,S. Slater*; T. F. Slater; K. C. Baybayan,Sessioned,CAPER Ctr Phys and Astro Educ Res; University of Wyoming; University of Hawai`i- Hilo,"Abstract Body: This poster provides an introduction to the astronomy of the Hawaiian wayfinders, Kilohoku Ho`okele Wa`a. Rooted in a legacy of navigation across the Polynesian triangle, wayfinding astronomy has been part of a suite of skills that allows navigators to deliberately hop between the small islands of the Pacific, for thousands of years. Forty years ago, in one manifestation of the Hawaiian Renaissance, our teachers demonstrated that ancient Hawaiians were capable of traversing the wide Pacific to settle and trade on islands separated by thousands of miles. Today those same mentors train a new generation of navigators, making Hawaiian voyaging a living, evolving, sustainable endeavor. This poster presents two components of astronomical knowledge that all crewmen, but particularly those in training to become navigators, learn early in their training. Na Ohana Hoku, the Hawaiian Star Families constitute the basic units of the Hawaiian sky. In contrast to the Western system of 88 constellations, Na Ohana Hoku divides the sky into four sections that each run from the northern to the southern poles. This configuration reduces cognitive load, allowing the navigator to preserve working memory for other complex tasks. In addition, these configurations of stars support the navigator in finding and generatively using hundreds of individual, and navigationally important pairs of stars. The Hawaiian Star Compass divides the celestial sphere into a directional system that uses 32 rather than 8 cardinal points. Within the tropics, the rising and setting of celestial objects are consistent within the Hawaiian Star Compass, providing for extremely reliable direction finding. Together, Na Ohana Hoku and the Hawaiian Star Compass provide the tropical navigator with astronomical assistance that is not available to, and would have been unknown to Western navigators trained at higher latitudes.\n",8,

C. Sterling*,N. C. Sterling*; A. B. Kerlin,Sessioned,University of West Georgia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present preliminary results of a study of the photoionization (PI) and recombination properties of low-charge Xe ions.  The abundances of neutron(<i>n</i>)-capture elements (atomic number <i>Z </i>> 30) are of interest in planetary nebulae (PNe) since they can be enriched by slow <i>n</i>-capture nucleosynthesis (the ``<i>s</i>-process'') in the progenitor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.  Xe is particularly valuable, because it is the most widely-observed ``heavy-<i>s</i>'' species (<i>Z</i> > 40) in PNe.  Its abundance relative to lighter <i>n</i>-capture elements can be used to determine <i>s</i>-process neutron exposures, and constrain <i>s</i>-process enrichment patterns as a function of progenitor metallicity.  Using the atomic structure code AUTOSTRUCTURE (Badnell 2011, Comp. Phys. Comm., 182, 1528), we have computed multi-configuration Breit-Pauli distorted-wave PI cross sections and radiative recombination (RR) and dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients for neutral through six-times ionized Xe, data which are critically needed for accurate Xe abundance determinations in ionized nebulae.  We find good agreement between our computed direct PI cross sections and experimental measurements.  Internal uncertainties are estimated for our calculations by using three different configuration interaction expansions for each ion, and by testing the sensitivity of our results to the radial orbital scaling parameters.  As found for other <i>n</i>-capture elements (Sterling & Witthoeft 2011, A&A, 529, A147; Sterling 2011, A&A, 533, A62), DR is the dominant recombination mechanism for Xe ions at nebular temperatures (~10<sup>4</sup> K).  Following Sterling et al. (2015, ApJS, 218, 25), these data will be added to nebular modeling codes to compute ionization correction factors for unobserved Xe ions in PNe, which will enable elemental Xe abundances to be determined with much higher accuracy than is currently possible.

Sterling,Sessioned,University of West Georgia; University of Montana; Western Michigan University; University of Connecticut; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Hobart and William Smith Colleges,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present results of an investigation into the photoionization (PI), recombination, and electron-impact excitation properties of low-charge Br and Rb ions.  Br and Rb are among the relatively few neutron(<i>n</i>)-capture elements (atomic number <i>Z</i> > 30) that have been detected in planetary nebulae (PNe).  Their abundances can reveal unique information regarding nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, including slow <i>n</i>-capture (<i>s</i>-process) neutron densities and the dominant neutron source in more massive AGB stars (4-8 solar masses).  However, the requisite atomic data needed for accurate Rb and Rb nebular abundance determinations are unknown.  Our work addresses this need, via a synthesis of theoretical and experimental methods.  Using the AUTOSTRUCTURE atomic structure code (Badnell 2011, Comp. Phys. Comm., 182, 1528), we have computed multi-configuration Breit-Pauli distorted-wave PI cross sections, and rate coefficients for radiative recombination (RR) and dielectronic recombination (DR) for neutral through six-times ionized Br and Rb.   To benchmark our calculations, we have measured absolute PI cross sections of Br<sup>+</sup>-Br<sup>4+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup>-Rb<sup>5+</sup> at the Advanced Light Source synchrotron radiation facility in Berkeley, CA.  Breit-Pauli R-matrix calculations are in progress to facilitate analysis of the experimental data, including resonance identifications and determining the metastable populations of the primary ion beams.  Finally, we are performing R-matrix calculations of effective collision strengths for electron-impact excitation of astrophysically detected Br and Rb ions.  Our Rb<sup>3+</sup> effective collision strength results have been applied to two PNe, with excellent agreement found for ionic abundances determined from different [Rb IV] lines.  The combination of these atomic data will dramatically improve the accuracy of Br and Rb abundance determinations in astrophysical nebulae, providing new insight into heavy element nucleosynthesis in low- and intermediate-mass stars.

Redfield,Sessioned,University of West Georgia; University of Texas; University of Washington; University of Texas-San Antonio; McDonald Observatory; Georgia Institute of Technology; Wesleyan University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present the abundances of neutron(n)-capture elements (atomic number <i>Z </i>> 30) and iron determined from deep optical echelle spectroscopy of 14 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe). The spectra were obtained with the 2D-coudé spectrograph on the 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory. The abundances of <i>n</i>-capture elements can be enhanced in PNe due to slow <i>n</i>-capture nucleosynthesis in the progenitor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The high spectral resolution of these data (<i>R </i>= 36,700) allow most <i>n</i>-capture element emission lines to be resolved from other nebular and telluric features. We detect Kr in all of the observed PNe (with multiple ions detected in several objects), while Br, Rb, and Xe were each detected in 4--5 objects. Using the new Kr ionization correction factors (ICFs) of Sterling et al. (2015, ApJS, 218, 25), we find [Kr/O] abundances ranging from 0.05 to 1.1 dex. We utilize approximate ICFs for the other <i>n</i>-capture elements, and find slightly lower enrichments for Br and Rb (-0.1 to 0.7 dex), while Xe is enhanced relative to solar by factors of two to 30. The [Xe/Kr] ratios range from -0.3 to 1.4 dex, indicating a significant range in neutron exposures in PN progenitor stars. Interestingly, the largest [Xe/Kr] ratio is found in the thick-disk PN NGC 6644, which has a lower metallicity than the other observed PNe. We detect iron emission lines in all but one target. Fe can be depleted into dust grains in ionized nebulae, and its abundance thus provides key information regarding dust-to-gas ratios and grain destruction processes. We find that [Fe/O] ranges from -1.3 to -0.7 dex in the observed PNe, a smaller spread of depletion factors than found in recent studies (Delgado-Inglada & Rodriguez 2014, ApJ, 784, 173) though this may be due in part to our smaller sample. These data are part of a larger study of heavy elements in PNe, which will provide more accurate determinations of <i>n</i>-capture element abundances than previous estimates in several PNe, thereby providing key new constraints to models of AGB nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.

Our Cycle 21 program leverages archival ACS/WFC deep H-alpha and continuum imaging for four fields by obtaining new WFC3 [S II] and [O III] imaging; also, one new field has been completely done with WFC3. The region covered extends to ~12 kpc, but is asymmetrical with respect to the nucleus.  Of the 93 SNR candidates known from ground-based imaging, 31 are within the new WFC3 coverage and all but two are confirmed.  Additionally, we have identified 23 new strong SNR candidates and another 37 second-tier candidates within the WFC3 footprint.  Thus, we have likely more than doubled the number of SNR candidates in the sampled region. We measure diameters for the sample and compare to other galaxy samples such as in M83 (which has more small diameter SNRs).  At least 25 of the sources appear to have X-ray counterparts in deep Chandra data.  Interestingly, no strong candidates for young, ejecta-dominated (Cas A-like) SNRs have been found in the sample to date.  Scaling up to the entire galaxy, there should be well over 200 detectable SNRs in M101 if a full survey was performed.<br /> <br />We acknowledge support from STScI grant HST-GO-13361-01-A to the Johns Hopkins University.\n",5,

These spectra of the central optical knots do not show any emission from elements with Z higher than Si, yet the nucleosynthesis models predict significant quantities of these higher Z elements.  Our spectral analysis of the deep XMM data clearly shows emission lines from S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, with indications of other possible features between Ca and Fe.  We use a combination of the high resolution images from Chandra and the sensitive spectra from XMM to disentangle the emission from swept-up interstellar material and a possible hot ejecta component.

The improved angular resolution and photon acceptance of the Pass 8 event reconstruction significantly aids in characterizing source extension and assessing spectral and morphological properties, a key consideration for studies of PWNe and SNRs in the gamma-ray band. Selecting photons above 10 GeV strikes a balance between keeping photon statistics high and diffuse gamma-ray emission low, and also carries benefits of a near constancy with energy of the point spread function of the LAT.

The Galactic SNR IC 443 is among the brightest and best-studied of such systems, detected as an extended gamma-ray source at both GeV and TeV energies. Previous observations with the AGILE and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray space telescopes have shown a low-energy cutoff at <200 MeV indicating relativistic protons are responsible for gamma-ray emission. Observations by the MAGIC and VERITAS ground-based gamma-ray telescopes show a steepening spectrum at TeV energies. Now, with updated Fermi-LAT observations using 7 yr of Pass 8 data above 1 GeV, the gamma-ray morphology of IC 443 is revealed as an inhomogeneous shell. Multi-wavelength observations have mapped the detailed physical conditions across the interaction site between the SNR and cloud, allowing us to separately study gamma-ray emission regions on scales less than 10 pc. We find an excellent correlation between GeV gamma-rays and the TeV morphology determined by VERITAS.

The interpretation of these sources is complex and their spectra differ appreciably from blackbodies. Further progress hinges on reducing the uncertainties stemming from models of neutron star atmospheres. We present a suite of low-temperature neutron star atmospheres of different chemical compositions (pure H and He). Our models are constructed over a range of temperatures [<i>log(T/1 </i>K<i>)</i>=5.3, 5.6, 5.9, 6.2, 6.5] and surface gravities [<i>log(g/1 </i>cm/s<sup>2</sup><i>)</i>=14.0, 14.2, 14.4, 14.6]. We generated model atmospheres using <b>zcode</b> - a radiation transfer code developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In order to facilitate analytic studies, we developed three-parameter fits to our models, and also compared them to diluted blackbodies in the energy range of 0.4-5 keV (CXO/MGE). From the latter, we extract color-correction factors (f<sub>c</sub>), which represent the shift of the spectra as compared to a blackbody with the same effective temperature. These diluted blackbodies are also useful for studies of photspheric expansion X-ray bursts. We provide a comparison of our models to previous calculations using the McGill Planar Hydrogen Atmosphere Code (McPHAC). These results enhance our ability to interpret thermal emission from neutron stars and to constrain the mass-radius relationship of these exotic objects.<br /><br />This research was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy under grant DE-FG02-87ER40317 and by resources at the Institute for Advanced Computational Science at Stony Brook University.

Vlemmings,Sessioned,Union College; Cornell University; Chalmers University of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Neutron stars are the remnants of massive stars after their deaths in supernova explosions. They typically have higher velocities than their progenitor stellar population due to either kicks from supernova asymmetries or from remnant velocities of compact binaries after they are disrupted by explosions.  Velocities are large enough that pulsars will typically move large distances from their birth sites. By determining the present day location and velocity, we project back to twice the pulsars characteristic age to constrain the location of the progenitor star (within the uncertainty of the unknown line-of-sight velocity component).  We use precision measurements of the proper motion and parallax determined with the Very Long Baseline Array as input to trajectory modeling that includes deceleration in the Galactic potential. Using a python implementation utilizing astropy and galpy, we verify the results of Vlemmings et al.

The excellent timing stability of millisecond pulsars can be used to study a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, observations of a large sample of these pulsars can be used to detect the presence of low-frequency gravitational waves. We have developed and are now commissioning a precision pulsar timing backend for the Deep Space Network (DSN), which will allow the use of short gaps in tracking schedules to observe and time pulses from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars. The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) operates clusters of large dish antennas (up to 70-m in diameter), located roughly equi-distant around the Earth, for communication and tracking of deep-space spacecraft. The backend system is capable of removing entirely the dispersive effects of propagation of radio waves through the interstellar medium in real-time.

Seymour,Sessioned,University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus; Penn State Univ.; NAIC,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The pulsar B1257+12 was regularly observed and timed by Aleksander Wolszczan from its discovery in 1992 up to 2008. It is the first example of an exoplanet-pulsar system, and is modeled to consist of three planets. At the time, long term timing programs lacked the sensitivity to measure effects that low mass, short orbital period bodies would have on the pulse arrival times (TOA's) and its timing residuals. Newer technology, like the PUPPI backend at Arecibo, allows for the exploration of an untouched planet parameter space. The project consisted of conducting precise timing using PUPPI, taking two hour long observations at 327 MHz, 430 MHz, and L-Band Wide (LBW) frequencies for 25 days. The data is processed in order to obtain standard profiles and TOA's that would be introduced into TEMPO2, allowing data point manipulation by fitting them for known pulsar parameters to acquire post fit residuals with expected precisions below 1 μs. The observations yielded residuals ranging between 0.40 μs and 1.89 μs for 430 MHz and 327 MHz, while LBW resulted in values higher than 4.0 μs, which is attributed to the many radio frequency interference (RFI) bands present in the data. Combining the newly and previously acquired data revealed a decrease in the dispersion measure (DM), from 10.16550 pc/cm3 to 10.15325 pc/cm3, since the pulsar was last observed, which allowed a correction for the effects of interstellar scintillation, which are most noticed at 327 MHz.\n",8,

During this period, a powerful X-ray outburst from SGR J1745-2900 occurred on 2013-04-24. Enhanced radio emission is delayed with respect to the X-ray peak by about seven months. In addition, the flux density of the emission from the magnetar fluctuates by a factor of 2 to 4 at frequencies between 21 and 41 GHz, and its spectral index varies erratically. As for Sgr A*, monitoring data shows a constant flux density and spectral index during this period, in spite of the variability of Sgr A* expected to be induced by the passage of the G2 cloud. We argue that the excess fluctuating emission from the magnetar arises from the interaction of a shock generated from the X-ray outburst with the orbiting ionized gas at the Galactic center. This continuum emission is in addition to pulsed emission from the pulsar. In this picture, variable synchrotron emission is produced by ram pressure variations due to inhomogeneities in the dense ionized medium of the Sgr A West bar. The pulsar, with its high transverse velocity, is moving through a highly blue-shifted ionized medium. This implies that the magnetar is at a projected distance of ~0.1 pc from Sgr A*, and that the orbiting ionized gas is at least partially responsible for a large rotation measure detected toward the magnetar.\n",9,

The primary motivation for this search is that a pulsar in the Galactic Center region (especially one that is gravitationally bound to the massive black hole at the GC) would provide unprecedented tests of gravity in the strong-field regime and would offer an entirely new tool for probing the characteristics of the Galactic Center region. Preparation for the GC pulsar search has involved the development of a single-pulse search pipeline that integrates tools from both Fortran and Python as well as the implementation of this pipeline on high performance CPUs. The original version of the search pipeline was developed using Vela Pulsar data from DSS-43, and a more refined version that relies upon chi-squared fitting techniques was ultimately developed using Crab Pulsar data. Future work will involve continued testing of the single-pulse search pipeline using data from the rotating radio transient (RRAT) J1819-1458, the characterization of RRAT pulses using high time resolution data from the new receiver system on DSS-43, and ultimately the analysis of high-frequency data using the existing pipeline to search for millisecond pulsars in the Galactic Center.\n",10,

Magnetic inverse Compton scattering is believed to be the leading candidate for the production of this intense X-ray radiation. Scattering at ultra-relativistic energies leads to attractive simplifications in the analytics of the magnetic Compton cross section. We have recently addressed such a case by developing compact analytic expressions using correct spin-dependent widths acquired through the implementation of Sokolov & Ternov basis states, focusing specifically on ground-state−ground-state scattering. Compton scattering in magnetar magnetospheres can cool electrons down to mildly relativistic energies. Moreover, soft gamma-ray flaring in magnetars may involve strong Comptonization in expanding clouds of mildly relativistic pairs. Such environs necessitate the development of more general magnetic scattering cross sections, in which the incoming photons acquire substantial incident angles relative to the field in the rest frame of the electron leading to arbitrary Landau excitations of the intermediate and final states. Due to the rapid transitions of the excited-state to the ground-state, the initial electron is still assumed to be in the ground state. The cross sections treat the plethora of harmonic resonances associated with various cyclotron transitions between Landau states. Polarization and spin dependence of the cross section for the four scattering modes is compared to the cross section obtained with spin-averaged widths. We present numerical results to show the comparisons to highlight the role of the spin-dependent widths of the resonances. The findings presented here will have applications to various neutron star problems, including computation of Eddington luminosities and polarization mode-switching rates in transient magnetar fireballs.\n",11,

As such sources appear to violate the Eddington Limit for the expected masses of stellar remnants, ULX may represent a class of super-Eddington objects, ""intermediate"" mass black holes (IMBH) emitting at sub-Eddington levels, or a diverse population including examples of both. Most initial efforts to search for radio emission associated with ULX did so with high angular resolution in hopes of applying the ""fundamental plane of black hole activity"" which relates X-ray luminosity, radio luminosity, and black hole mass. The predicted radio flux densities for such compact radio emission are quite low meaning that even non-detections leave open much of the mass range associated with IMBH. However, a small number of ULX have been associated with extended radio emission and these radio nebulae have sizes and energetics that differentiate them from more common classes of extended objects such as HII regions and supernova remnants. We report here on the results of a cohesive study to identify and characterize ULX radio nebula associated with unbiased samples of ULX. This study has two prongs: one relying upon archival Very Large Array data and one using new, dedicated Jansky Very Large Array observations.

In a sample of 81’192 galaxies taken from the seventh data release (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift interval 0.02 < z < 0.05 and with r < 17 AB mag, the Baldwin, Philips & Terlevitsch 1981 method (BPT) identifies 1029 objects as active galactic nuclei. By applying an analysis using HeII λ 4686 emission lines, based on Shirazi & Binchmann 2012, we have identified an additional 283 active galactic nuclei, which were missed by the BPT method. This represents an increase of over 25 %. The characteristics of the HeII selected AGN are different from the AGN found through the PBT; the colour - mass diagram and the colour histogram both show that HeII selected AGN are bluer. This new selection technique can help inform galaxy black hole coevolution scenarios.\n",20,

Blackburn*,S. Blackburn*; K. S. Ford; B. McKernan,Sessioned,BMCC-CUNY,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) can be absorbed by nearby stars. As a consequence of resonance between the GW frequency and quadrupolar modes in stars, observable changes in luminosity are expected as the star absorbs and subsequently discharges energy. While it has previously been shown that GWs can do work on nearby compact stars, resonant heating of normal stars has not yet been fully explored. By modeling such stars as driven, damped harmonic oscillators, we examine which stars and stellar oscillations can become saturated (versus unsaturated) for physically plausible binary-oscillator pairings. Using such models, we can compute the total energy deposited in any given toy model star. Energy deposition can then be used to compute the luminosity and structural changes expected in realistic stars.\n",21,

Cohen*,T. Cohen*; C. J. Salter; T. Ghosh,Sessioned,Stony Brook University; National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient radio sources whose high dispersion measures suggest they are of extra-galactic origin. They are particularly difficult to detect because, unlike other fast radio transients, they are non-recurring events. At present, 11 such bursts have been detected, 10 by the Parkes Radio Telescope and one by Arecibo Observatory. The G-ALFA Continuum Transit Survey (GALFACTS) is the highest resolution, full-Stokes, radio-continuum survey of the foreground sky. The Arecibo radio telescope is the largest single-aperture telescope in the world, offering the superior point-source sensitivity necessary to detect additional FRBs. GALFACTS utilizes Arecibo's ALFA receiver, an L-band 7-beam feed array, to produce a high-time (1 ms), low-spectral (MHz) resolution (HTLS) data stream between 1225 and 1525 MHz. We used ``Red_Transient"", a robust search pipeline developed by A.A. Deshpande, to de-disperse the HTLS data with the intention of detecting FRBs in the ~30% of the total sky surveyed by GALFACTS. Concurrently, the student produced a similar search pipeline to calibrate HTLS data and validate detections by ``Red_Transient"". Here, we present the results of initial processing runs on the first several days of GALFACTS observations. Currently, no FRB detections have been found. However, the detection of pulses from the known pulsar J1916+1312 indicates that ``Red_Transient"" is capable of detecting fast transient signals present in the data stream.\n",22,

You,Sessioned,St. Mary's School,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Rogue Valley in Southwest Oregon was known for its beautiful dark skies, but due to population growth the dark skies are vanishing. A light pollution chart using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data was published in 2006, but did not show the spatial variation in detail. In the spring of 2014, the 9<sup>th</sup> grade physics students, astronomy students, and members of the Astronomy Club from St. Mary’s School conducted the first detailed night sky survey. The purpose of the survey is to create a baseline of the variations in light pollution in the Rogue Valley.<br /><br />The project continued into 2015, incorporating suggestions made at the 2014 AAS Conference to improve the study by including more light meter data and community outreach. Students used light meters, Loss of the Night app, and the Dark Sky meter app. Students researched light pollution and its effects on the environment, measured night sky brightness in the Rogue Valley, and completed a light audit in an area of their choice. They created a presentation for a final physics grade. The basis for this project, along with procedures can be found on the GaN, Globe at Night, (www.globeatnight.org) website. The light audit and research portion were developed from the Dark Sky Rangers section of the website (www.globeatnight.org/dsr/).<br /><br />The 2014 survey and public outreach increased awareness of light pollution in the Rogue Valley and around the state of Oregon. Examples include a local senior project to change lighting at a baseball stadium and a 4-H club in Northeast Oregon starting a GaN survey in their area. GaN shows growth in the amount of data collected in Oregon from 8 data points in 2006 to 193 in 2014. The Rogue Valley magnitude data from the spring of 2015 indicates a drop from an average magnitude of 4 to an average magnitude of 2. This is due to hazy skies from smoke drifting into the valley from a Siberian wildfire. Data collection during the summer and fall was hampered due to smoke from local wildfires.\n",1,

When entering an institution with quantitative and analytical scientific theory it is important to make sure that all parts of a system correlates in a structured and systematic manner so that all areas of intricacy will be prevented or quickly deduced. My research focused on interpreting and implementing Systems Engineering techniques in the construction, integration and operation of a NASA Radio Jove Kit to Observe Jupiter radio emissions. Jupiter emissions read at very low frequencies so when building the telescope it had to be able to read less than 39.5 MHz. The projected outcome was to receive long L-bursts and short S-burts signals; however, during the time of observation Jupiter was in conjunction with the Sun. We then decided to use the receiver built from the NASA Radio Jove Kit to hook it up to the Karl Jansky telescope to make an effort to listen to solar flares as well, nonetheless, we were unable to identify these signals and further realized they were noise. The overall project was a success in that we were able to apply and comprehend, the principles of Systems Engineering to facilitate the build.\n",7,

The abundances were measured from high signal-to-noise medium resolution spectra collected with the Hydra multi-object spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5- meter telescope. M53 is of interest because previous studies based on the morphology of the cluster's horizontal branch suggested that it might be composed primarily of first generation (FG) stars and differ from the majority of other GCs with<br />multiple populations, which have been found to be dominated by second generation (SG) stars. Our sample has an average [Fe/H] = -2.07 with a standard deviation of 0.07 dex. This value is consistent with previously<br />published results. The alpha-element abundances in our sample are also consistent with the trends seen in Milky Way halo stars at similar metallicities, with enhanced [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] relative to solar. We find that<br />the Na-O anti-correlation is not as extended as other GCs with similarly high masses. The fraction of SG to FG stars in our sample is approximately 1:3 and the SG is more centrally concentrated. These findings further support that M53 might be a mostly FG cluster and could give further insight into how GCs formed the light element abundance patterns we observe in them today.\n",2,

These clusters tend to be very massive, have >0.1 dex intrinsic metallicity dispersions, have complex sub-giant branch morphologies, and have correlated [Fe/H] and s-process element enhancements. Interestingly, nearly all of these clusters discovered so far have [Fe/H]~-1.7. In this context, we have examined the chemical composition of 18 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the massive, metal-poor Galactic bulge globular cluster NGC 6273 using high signal-to-noise, high resolution (R~27,000) spectra obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) and MSpec spectrograph mounted on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the cluster exhibits a metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-1.80 to -1.30 and is composed of two dominant populations separated in [Fe/H] and [La/Fe] abundance.  The increase in [La/Eu] as a function of [La/H] suggests that the increase in [La/Fe] with [Fe/H] is due to almost pure s-process enrichment.  The most metal-rich star in our sample is not strongly La-enhanced, but is α-poor and may belong to a third ""anomalous"" stellar population. The two dominant populations exhibit the same [Na/Fe]-[Al/Fe] correlation found in other ""normal"" globular clusters. Therefore, NGC 6273 joins ω Centauri, M 22, M 2, and NGC 5286 as a possible new class of Galactic globular clusters.\n",3,

However, old, massive globular clusters—with ages greater than 10 billion years—often host multiple stellar populations, indicating that more than one star-forming event may have occurred during their lifetimes. The most popular scenario for their formation invokes colliding stellar winds from late-stage, asymptotic-giant-branch stars. If this were correct, the initial globular cluster masses should be at least 10 times more massive than their current masses of typically a few x 10<sup>5</sup> Msun. However, large populations of clusters with masses greater than a few x 10<sup>6</sup> Msun are not found in the local Universe. Here we present <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i> observations of three 1–2 billion-year-old, massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds which show unequivocal evidence of burst-like star-formation activity that occurred a few x 10<sup>8</sup> years after their initial formation era. The spatial distributions of the younger stellar generations suggest that they may have originated from ambient gas clouds accreted by the clusters while orbiting in the disks of their host galaxies rather than from colliding stellar winds. Simple models imply that such clusters could indeed accrete sufficient gas reservoirs to form these stars. This may eventually give rise to the appearance of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters.\n",4,

(2011) used the Hubble Space Telescope to localize probable globular clusters in M81, a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. Theory predicts that such clusters can host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses of 100 - 100,000 solar masses. We used the NRAO Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to search for the radiative signatures of IMBH accretion from 206 clusters in a mosaic of M81. The wavelength was 5.5 cm and the resolution was 1.5 arcsec (26 pc). None of the individual clusters are detected, nor is a weighted-mean stack of their images that achieved a 1-sigma rms of 430 nanoJy/beam. Applying a formalism developed for globular clusters in the Milky Way, the stack’s radio-luminosity upper limit corresponds to a mean 3-sigma IMBH mass of less than 41,000 solar masses. The associated sphere of influence has a radius of less than 20 mas (0.35 pc) and crosschecks based on stellar dynamics must await the advent of NIR telescopes in the 30 m class (e.g., Do et al. 2014). The NRAO is a facility of the NSF, operated under cooperative agreement by AUI.\n",10,

Kuhn,Sessioned,University of Wyoming; Large Binocular Telescope Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We are studying star clusters in NGC 2655, a shell elliptical galaxy that is likely a post-merger remnant and may yet still be forming new stars. Our project consists of two parts. The first goal is to put together a pipeline for taking raw images and transforming them into a final calibrated set of data. The algorithms we have developed will be useful for all astronomers who use the Large Binocular Cameras (LBCs) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) located on Mount Graham in Arizona. The LBCs are two widefield f/1.45 cameras each mounted at prime focus for each mirror of the LBT. The LBCs each have a 23' x 25' field of view (FOV) and optimized for 0.3-0.6 microns on the left mirror and 0.5-1.0 microns on the right mirror.<br /><br />The second goal is to effectively take a population census of young star clusters (YSCs) and Globular Clusters (GCs) in a galaxy undergoing a transformation from two spiral galaxies into an elliptical galaxy. NGC 2655 may be a future version of our Milky Way after it collides and merges with the Andromeda Galaxy. Stars are born in groups and clusters. When mergers occur between spiral galaxies, vast reservoirs of gas are turned into stars and these stars all form together in large clusters with masses ranging from 10$^{4}$-10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$. As seen in major mergers like the Antennae and NGC 3256, thousands of such star clusters are formed during and after a galaxy merger. However, NGC 2655 is clearly an elliptical galaxy with strong indications of having undergone a recent major merger. Thus, it represents a transition object, allowing us to study both the GC and possibly YSC populations. Although similar studies have been undertaken for a handful of other similar transition objects (i.e. NGC 1316), they have all been done using imagers with rather small FOVs ($\sim$ 2-6'). The large FOV of the LBCs allow us to capture not only the entire galaxy, but a large region surrounding the galaxy, making it possible to obtain a better census of GCs and YSCs without relying on extrapolating the properties from small FOVs.\n",12,

This galaxy, located at ~3 Mpc, hosts an intense starburst, which includes a centrally-concentrated dusty region with strong thermal radio emission (the `radio nebula'). The HST imaging includes data from the Cycle 21 Treasury Program LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey), in addition to narrow--band H-alpha (6563 A), P-beta (12820 A), and P-alpha (18756 A). The bright clusters have ages ~1-15 Myr and masses ~1E4 - 2.5E5 Msun. Two of the 11 star clusters are located within the radio nebula, and suffer from significant dust attenuation. Both are extremely young, with a best-fit age around 1 Myr, and masses ~7.5E4 and ~2.5E5 Msun, respectively. The most massive of the two `radio nebula' clusters is 2-4 times less massive than previously estimated and is embedded within a cloud of dust with A_V~50 mag. The two clusters account for about half of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventually supply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. Additional sources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and may include very massive stars.\n",13,

Mahadevan,Sessioned,"University of Massachusetts, Amherst","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Catalogs describing populations of star clusters are essential in investigating a range of important issues, from star formation to galaxy evolution. Star cluster catalogs are typically created in a two-step process: in the first step, a catalog of sources is automatically produced; in the second step, each of the extracted sources is visually inspected by 3-to-5 human classifiers and assigned a category. Classification by humans is labor-intensive and time consuming, thus it creates a bottleneck, and substantially slows down progress in star cluster research.<br /><br />We seek to automate the process of labeling star clusters (the second step) through applying supervised machine learning techniques. This will provide a fast, objective, and reproducible classification. Our data is HST (WFC3 and ACS) images of galaxies in the distance range of 3.5–12 Mpc, with a few thousand star clusters already classified by humans as a part of the LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey) project. The classification is based on 4 labels (Class 1 – symmetric, compact cluster; Class 2 – concentrated object with some degree of asymmetry; Class 3 – multiple peak system, diffuse; and Class 4 – spurious detection). We start by looking at basic machine learning methods such as decision trees. We then proceed to evaluate performance of more advanced techniques, focusing on convolutional neural networks and other Deep Learning methods. We analyze the results, and suggest several directions for further improvement.\n",14,

Linden*,S. Linden*; A. S. Evans,Sessioned,University of Virginia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present an HST ACS/WFC analysis of the age and mass distribution of bright, optically-visible clusters in local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). These galaxies host the most extreme star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, with their observed activity triggered by the interaction or merger of gas-rich galaxies. We constructed extinction-corrected color-color diagrams and compare the observed colors with predictions from the Bruzal & Charlot (2003) Simple Stellar Population Models in order to estimate the ages and masses of individual clusters. We find that, for an instantaneous starburst and Salpeter IMF, the estimated cluster ages for the sample are consistent with the cluster destruction rate derived for the Antennae Galaxies (Fall et al. 2005). For LIRGs with detailed dynamical modeling, we find that their oldest clusters have ages consistent with the time since pericentric passage. The derived cluster mass function for the sample is also consistent with SFR-normalized mass functions for a wide range of star-forming galaxies in the Local Universe, indicating the general similarity among the cluster populations of different galaxies. This study is part of the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS).\n",15,

A. Knierman*,K. A. Knierman*; P. A. Scowen; C. E. Groppi,Sessioned,School of Earth and Space Exploration - Arizona State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, they are less common than minor mergers (mass ratios <0.3) and likely played a role in forming most large galaxies, including the Milky Way.  Tidal debris regions have large reservoirs of neutral gas but a lower gas density and may have higher turbulence.  Star formation tracers such as young star cluster populations, star cluster complexes, and H-alpha, CO, molecular hydrogen, and CII emission were studied to determine the different factors that may influence star formation in tidal debris.  These tracers were compared to the reservoirs of gas available for star formation to estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE).  In our pilot study using two of the sample of 15 minor mergers, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) of minor merger tidal debris can reach up to 50% of the total star formation in the system which is comparable to prior simulations of star formation in major mergers.  The SFE of tidal tails in minor mergers can range over orders of magnitude on both local and global scales.  From the tidal debris environments in this study, this variance appears to stem from the formation conditions of the debris.   Further work on the 13 additional minor mergers in this sample will shed more light on the factors influencing star formation in low density environments. <br />\n",16,

We separate the clusters into different classes, defined by their (a)symmetry and number of peaks, comparing the trends of the autocorrelation functions between all the cluster classes. For one galaxy, NGC 628, we find that younger star clusters are more strongly clustered over small spatial scales and that the clustering disappears rapidly for ages as young as 40 Myr.

Chen*,X. Chen*; M. S. Oey; J. B. Lamb; C. Kushner,Sessioned,University of Michigan; Nassau Community College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Massive stars have long been thought to form in clusters. However, recent observations suggest some massive stars form in extremely sparse environments. Could these massive stars form alone? Clarifying the nature of field OB stars is central to this question. Defining these as OB stars that are isolated from other OB stars, the field comprises three distinct populations: “tip-of-the-iceberg stars”, which are in small, but normal, clusters that only have one OB star; runaway stars; and any stars that form in situ in the field. The relative frequencies of each category are unknown. To study the population and obtain estimates of the frequencies, we examine 134 field OB stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4; Lamb et al. 2015) in the bar region of the Small Magellanic Cloud. These stars are at least 28 pc in projection away from other OB stars. We use OGLE-III (Udalski et al. 2008) <i>I</i>-band images to search for small, potential clusters around our target stars, using friends-of-friends and nearest-neighbor algorithms. We estimate the relative frequencies of tip-of-the-iceberg stars and isolated stars, some of which may have formed in situ.<br /> <br />Thanks to Radek Poleski for help with the OGLE-III database.

We combine the catalog by Heiles (2000) with uvbyβ photometric data from the catalog of Paunzen (2015) to collate a sample of O and B-type stars with precise homogeneous distances, color excess and available polarimetry. This allows us to identify star-forming sites at different distances along the line of sight and to investigate their spatial correlation to the interstellar matter. Further, we use this sample to study the orientation of the polarization as revealed by the polarized light of the bright early-type stars and analyze the polarization-extinction correlation for this field. Since dust grains align in the presence of a magnetic field cause the observed polarization at optical wavelengths, the data contain information about the large-scale component of the Galactic magnetic field. In addition, wide-field astrophotography equipment was used to image the Cygnus field in Hydrogen-alpha, Hydrogen-beta and the [OIII] line at 500.7 nm. This allows us to map the overall distribution of ionized material and the interstellar dust and trace large-scale regions where the physical conditions change rapidly due to supernova shock fronts and strong stellar winds.

Since in this direction the line of sight is along the local Orion spiral arm, the isolation of individual stellar and interstellar structures is difficult. This study is focused on the massive stellar content of Sh 2-109 with the purpose of providing new insights on its structure. We use the catalog of optically visible open clusters and candidates (Dias et al. 2014) to study the properties of the open-cluster population within the boundaries of the Sh 2-109 star-forming region. We also utilize photometric uvbyβ data for the massive stars in Sh 2-109. This data set includes more than 10 young open clusters. Since the intermediate-band uvbyβ photometry allows the derivation of stellar physical parameters with high precision, we provide homogeneous distance and age estimates to the OB-associations identified toward Sh 2-109.

De Marchi*,G. De Marchi*; N. Panagia,Sessioned,ESA; STScI,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Up to ages of ~100 Myr, massive clusters are still swamped in large amounts of gas and dust, causing considerable and uneven levels of extinction. At the same time, large grains (ices?) produced by type II supernovae profoundly alter the interstellar medium (ISM), thus resulting in extinction properties very different from those of the diffuse ISM. To obtain physically meaningful parameters of stars (luminosities, effective temperatures, masses, ages, etc.) we must understand and measure the local extinction law. We have developed a powerful method to unambiguously determine the extinction law everywhere across a cluster field, using multi-band photometry of red giant stars belonging to the red clump (RC) and are applying it to young massive clusters in the Local Group. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, with about 20 RC stars per arcmin<sup>2</sup>, for each field we can easily derive an accurate extinction curve over the entire wavelength range of the photometry. As an example, we present the extinction law of the Tarantula nebula (30 Dor) based on thousands of stars observed as part of the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project. We discuss how the incautious adoption of the Milky Way extinction law in the analysis of massive star forming regions may lead to serious underestimates of the fluxes and of the star formation rates by factors of 2 or more.\n",22,

As part of an ongoing multi wavelength study, we focus on Hectochelle data from the MMT to measure the radial velocities of 499 stars. After removing binaries, outliers, and imposing a minimum R value to the cross correlation, we obtain radial velocities of 57 previously identified members, with an average error of 1.7 km/s. There is no observed variation in radial velocity across the cluster in right ascension or declination. The preferred mechanism for this type of kinematic evolution is that any initial kinematic structure from formation may have been erased and that minimal or no rotation is present in the cluster. However, the Eastern sub-cluster, containing the most massive star in the field, an O7 star, has a higher velocity dispersion than the Western sub-cluster, which contains several B stars. We will compare these results to CO maps of the residual gas in the cluster and discuss possible reasons for this difference. Finally, we will assess whether the cluster is bound or in a state of expansion.\n",23,

The IFMR tells us how much material a star ejects back into the ISM over the course of its lifetime, and is also crucial for deriving minimum ages of the galactic components from studies of the coolest white dwarf stars. We have taken deep multislit observations of M34, M35, M67, NGC6633, and NGC7063 using the Keck-II telescope. We have applied models to spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs which have zeroed in on each star's effective temperature and surface gravity. Cooling ages for these white dwarfs have in turn been determined, and subtracting this from the cluster's age has given us each white dwarfs main sequence lifetime. Isochrones in turn have been invoked to get each white dwarfs inital (ZAMS) mass. Analyzing data from five clusters of various ages has enabled us to sample a range of ZAMS masses, populating the initial mass parameter space which allows for a more precise IFMR.\n",26,

A key input into these simulations is the fraction and mass distribution of binary stars. The internal dynamics of stellar clusters is conducted primarily through N-Body simulations. A key input into these simulations is the fraction and mass distribution of binary stars. Currently the N-body input relations are taken from ""field"" binary stars studies, but to truly understand how clustered environments evolve, binary data from within star clusters is needed, including detailed mass information. The detailed information on binaries masses, primary and secondary, in star clusters has been limited to bright high mass stars that are reachable using decade-long radial velocity surveys. We introduce a new binary detection method, Binary INformation from Open Clusters Using SEDs (BINOCS) that covers the wide mass range needed to improve cluster N-body simulation inputs and comparisons. Using newly-observed multi-wavelength photometric catalogs (0.3 - 8 microns) of the key open clusters with a range of ages, we can show that the BINOCS method determines accurate binary component masses for unresolved cluster binaries through comparison to available RV-based studies. Using this method, we present results on the dynamical evolution of binaries from 0.4 - 2.5 solar masses within nine prototypical clusters, spaning 30 Myr to 7 Gyr, and show how the binary populations evolve, and discover significant variations in the ""dynamical age"" of a clusters as a function of the stellar mass range studied.\n",27,

We see abundance trends for Ba II, La II and Eu II that are consistent with Galactic abundance patterns for these elements. Ce II appears to be slightly enhanced in all program stars with a median value of ~0.1 dex and a spread of 0.5 dex for the entire sample.\n",29,

A. Carroll*,D. A. Carroll*,Sessioned,University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The recently discovered Green Pea galaxies display extreme starburst activity and may be some of the only possible Lyman continuum emitting galaxies at low redshift. Green Peas are characterized by their unusually high [O III]/[O II] ratios, similar to the ratios observed in high-redshift galaxies. In addition, the presence of the high-energy He II 4686 line shows that the Green Peas are highly ionized. However, the origin of the He II emission in the Green Peas, and many other starburst galaxies, is still an open question. We analyze IMACS and MagE spectra from the Magellan telescopes in order to evaluate the most probable cause of this He II emission. We also analyze other properties like dust content, temperature and density, and kinematic components. Our IMACS spectra show no Wolf-Rayet (WR) features. We set upper limits on the WR populations in our sample and conclude that Wolf-Rayet stars are not a likely candidate for the He II emission. With deeper MagE spectra we investigate energetic shocks as a possible source of the He II, and move one step closer to uncovering the origin of high-energy photons in these unique starbursts.\n",1,

Specifically, we measured selected CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, [CI], and [NII] integrated line fluxes in a sample of 145 star-forming galaxies covering a range of far-infrared luminosities ranging from 10<sup>9</sup> to above 10<sup>12</sup> L<sub>Sun </sub>. Thus, our sample includes typical, quiescent galaxies as well as Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) and Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), known to be creating stars extremely rapidly. We find evidence suggesting that ULIRGs with far-infrared luminosities of L<sub>FIR</sub>> 10<sup>12</sup> L<sub>Sun</sub> require an additional heating mechanism other than UV heating from star formation, while LIRGs and less luminous star-forming galaxies may be heated primarily by their star formation. We also find that the [NII] <sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub> - <sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub> fine structure line flux and those of the CO J=5-4, CO J=7-6, and CO J=8-7 transitions are generally weaker for ULIRGs compared to LIRGs and less luminous star-forming galaxies, while we find the CO J=11-10, CO J=12-11, and CO J=13-12 transitions are generally stronger. In all these respects, ULIRGs are shown to differ significantly from other galaxies undergoing less extreme star formation.

Ma*,J. Ma*; A. Gonzalez,Sessioned,University of Florida,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): To understand cosmic mass assembly in the Universe at early epochs, we primarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate of distant galaxies. In this paper, we present stellar masses and star formation rates of six high-redshift (2.8 ≤ z ≤ 5.7) dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. These sources were first discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at millimeter wavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derived from ALMA observations. We have conducted follow-up observations, obtaining multi-wavelength imaging data, using HST, Spitzer, Herschel and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX). We use the high-resolution HST/WFC3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lens in Spitzer/IRAC data. The detections and upper limits provide important constraints on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these DSFGs, yielding stellar masses, IR luminosities, and star formation rates (SFRs). The SED fits of six SPT sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a range more than one order of magnitude with a median value ∼ 5 ×10<sup>10</sup>M⊙. The intrinsic IR luminosities range from 4×10<sup>12</sup>L⊙ to 4×10<sup>13</sup>L⊙. They all have prodigious intrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 M⊙yr<sup>-1</sup>. Compared to the star-forming main sequence (MS), these six DSFGs have specific SFRs that all lie above the MS, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10 higher than the MS. Our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoing strong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.\n",4,

In the latter survey, broad-band R and narrow-band Hα filters were used to examine target galaxies from the ALFALFA blind HI survey (Giovanelli et al. 2005, Haynes et al. 2011). In the process of reducing the ALFALFA Hα Survey data the “Hα Dots” were discovered (Kellar et al. 2008, 2012). Using specialized image analysis tools, a large population of dots has already been detected in the more than 1500 ALFALFA Hα narrow-band images taken with the 0.9m WIYN and 2.1m KPNO telescopes. Follow-up spectra of over 200 Hα Dots discovered from the 0.9m images reveal that these objects are a mix of nearby low-luminosity star-forming galaxies, compact starbursts and Seyfert 2 galaxies at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift QSOs. Here we present the first list of Hα Dots detected using 2.1m telescope data. The 2.1m images yield a sample of Dots that average almost two magnitudes fainter than those detected with the 0.9m. The current REU project is designed to characterize the set of Hα Dots detected in the deeper 2.1m telescope images, while the broad goals of the Hα Dot Survey include the desire to understand better the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.

We have a sample of ""pure"" starburst galaxies at z~0.1 as selected by mean field independent component analysis (MFICA). In order to better understand these starburst galaxies, we attempt to identify nearby analogues. First, we degrade a random sample of nearby galaxies to a redshift of z~0.1 by decreasing brightness and spatial resolution and increasing signal-to-noise. We then compare the magnitude, color, morphology, and concentration of each of these galaxies to our pure starburst galaxies. Finally, we determine if the nearby galaxies most similar to the starbursts when degraded are consistent with the local optimally emitting cloud model (LOC). The LOC model makes predictions for the distribution of HII regions within starburst galaxies which have been previously tested with the spectra of z~0.1 galaxies, and may be further validated by examination of these nearby analogues.\n",7,

Hall,Sessioned,"Reed College; Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; Johns Hopkins University","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): At redshifts of z > 1.5, UV-selected galaxy populations (such as z ~ 3 Lyman break galaxies = LBGs) have the largest number of spectroscopic redshifts.  As a result, LBGs have an important role in our understanding of the history of galaxy formation.  However, LBGs are rather poorly understood at longer wavelengths, and thus our understanding of the total star formation rates and (especially) gas masses in such galaxies is incomplete.  A common strategy is to assume that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas mass surface density holds, even in these high redshift galaxies where testing the relation directly is not feasible.  To help assess the validity of this assumption, we examine the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in selected nearby (z ~ 0.2) starburst galaxies in the hope of better understanding key questions regarding star formation processes in UV-selected galaxies.  Several nearby galaxies with high UV luminosities and surface brightnesses, reminiscent of those found in LBGs, were identified and used for this project.  We have obtained new, spatially resolved observations of these nearby analogues in Paschen alpha emission and carbon monoxide emission, from the ESO Very Large Telescope and the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, respectively.  We examine whether the galaxies follow the expected Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and investigate any implied variation in gas depletion times between and within galaxies.

The escape of Lyα photons from galaxies is a key issue in studying high redshift galaxies and probing cosmic reionization with Lyα. To understand Lyα escape, it is valuable to study high quality Lyα profiles in Lyα emitters. However, such studies are rare due to the faintness of high-z Lyα emitters and the lack of local analogs with high Lyα equivalent width. Here we show that ”Green Pea” galaxies are the best local analogs of high-z Lyα emitters and their high quality Lyα profiles demonstrate low HI column density is the key to Lyα escape. The Lyα escape fraction shows correlations with the ratio of Lyα blue peak velocity to Hα line width, the normalized flux density at valley of Lyα profile, and a few other features of Lyα profiles. We compared the Lyα profiles with outflowing HI shell radiative transfer model and found that the best-fit HI column density is anti-correlated with the Lyα escape fraction. We also found an anti-correlation between Lyα escape fraction and galactic metallicity. Our results support that LAEs with high Lyα escape fraction have low metallicity, low HI column density, and mild HI gas outflow.\n",9,

However, past optical surveys of these galaxies have revealed a number 3 to 10 times lower than the number predicted. These surveys used ground-based radio and near-IR observations, but had a number of shortcomings including poor resolution and inability to detect high extinction events. The Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) offers several advantages over these ground-based surveys. First, the SST is able to maintain stable seeing in space. Furthermore, another advantage is at the longer wavelengths provided by Spitzer, the SNe in the nuclear regions of galaxies are less susceptible to extinction effects from dust. In order to detect the SNe through the heavy dust fields in ULIRGs, observations were taken at 3.6 μm with the warm IRAC camera on the SST. Here we present preliminary results from our SST survey of 40 ULIRGs. We describe the sensitivity of the survey given our current detection algorithm, which is limited in large part by an asymmetric Point Spread Function.

Initially classified a Type IIn due to early spectral features, it's subsequent spectral and photometric behavior over the first ~200 days led to two divergent explanations for the event. Citing photometric behavior atypical for any known explosion mechanisms, some have concluded this was ""supernova imposter,"" such as a giant eruption in a massive Luminous Blue Variable star.  Others report that its evolution was in fact consistent with the faintest Type-IIP SNe, which combined with the discovery of an intermediate-mass progenitor in mid-IR imaging, led to the conclusion that it was an electron-capture SN.  Using a combination of ground-based, Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-infrared, and Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared imaging, we have traced the optical-through-infrared evolution of the SN from outburst to disappearance by 2014.  We show that the limited intermediate-time optical data are consistent with radioactive 56-Co decay, however there are not enough late-time observations to assert with confidence whether or not the light curve supports a supernova hypothesis.  We also show that the mid-infrared source identified as the progenitor is still present after the disappearance of the SN, suggesting either that this source is unrelated to the progenitor, or that the progenitor has returned to its pre-outburst state.\n",6,

Wheeler,Sessioned,University of Szeged; University of Texas at Austin; Trinity University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The signs of circumstellar interaction in the late phase (>1 yr) of supernovae (SNe) can be studied in various wavelength regimes from X-ray to radio. These observations offer a chance to reveal information about the type and mass-loss history of the progenitor, the presence of a companion star, and the environment of the SN. While this phenomenon is well-known and well-studied concerning SN IIn, similar processes have not been observed to take place in other types of SNe.<br />We suggest that numeruous objects belong to other types of SNe (SNe Ia, Ib/c or IIb) may also show detectable sign of circumstellar interaction. In these types of SNe, the source of late-time mid-infrared (mid-IR) excess may be some kind of interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM) that originated from the pre-explosion mass-loss of the progenitor and/or its companion star. The observed mid-IR emission from these SNe, especially combined with data from other wavelength regimes, may be a convincing sign of CSM interaction.<br />Here we present some unpublished results based on the archive measurements of the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our study includes the analysis of late-time mid-IR emission from such well-known CSM-interacting SNe like SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx, SN Ibn 2001em, and SN IIb 1993J, as well as from some other interesting Type Ia and stripped-envelope SNe, where CSM interaction may also take place.\n",9,

Using this dataset, we introduce a novel method of identifying “twin” Type Ia supernovae by matching spectral data. For this initial set of SNfactory twin supernovae, we find a dispersion in luminosity of 0.083 ± 0.012 magnitudes between twins, implying a dispersion of 0.072 ± 0.010 magnitudes in the absence of peculiar velocities. This shows that at least 3/4 of the variance in Hubble residuals in current supernova cosmology analyses is due to previously unaccounted-for astrophysical differences among the supernovae -- differences captured by spectrophotometric twinning. We discuss both the usage of this method and the data requirements to implement it.\n",10,

Rose*,B. Rose*; P. M. Garnavich,Sessioned,University of Notre Dame,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) are important tools for precision cosmology. But there are still uncertainties about how the host galaxy properties and local environment influence the luminosity, color and Hubble residuals of SN Ia. We investigate these questions by analyzing high angular resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of SDSS-II host galaxies. These are ""snapshot"" images obtained while the telescope was slewing to new targets, so the total exposure times are less than 30 minutes. ACS images were obtained in F475W and F625W filters, similar to SDSS g and r-bands. In total, we observed 61 host galaxies in Stripe 82 that had SN Ia discovered by the SDSS-II SN Survey. HST's resolution and low background allow for detailed analysis of both the region around the SN Ia and the galaxy as a whole. Co-added SDSS-II images of the hosts are used to supplement the HST data in regions of low surface brightness. From this data set we estimate the fractional pixel rank and photometric color of the SN Ia's location and correlate the local environment variables with SN Ia luminosity, light curve width, color and Hubble residual. We assess the impact of these correlations on the accuracy of SN Ia distance estimates and possible biases in measuring the Hubble constant and dark energy parameters.\n",11,

SNAP consists of two data bases, an observational light curve data base and a theoretical light curve model data base, statistical comparison software, and a web interface available to the community. The observational light curves are primarily <i>Swift</i> UVOT core-collapse SNe and include all available observations from these observed SNe. The currently available theoretical models were developed at LANL. The web interface allows approved users to upload new SNe models or new SNe observations. The comparison software will validate new models against available SNe observations or rapidly give constraints on parameters for newly discovered SNe. With the advent of large computing abilities, more sophisticated SNe models are being developed. SNAP will be a tool to determine the accuracy of these new models. SNAP will also be a useful tool in the era of large surveys where thousands of SNe are discovered annually. Frequently, the parameter space of a new SNe event is unbounded. SNAP will be a resource to constrain parameters and determine if an event needs follow up without spending resources to create new light curve models from scratch.<br />\n",12,

Jenks*,M. Jenks*; E. A. Baron,Sessioned,University of Oklahoma,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The metallicity of progentitor systems of type Ia supernova can vary and are not well known. Variations in this can lead to differences in the observed spectra. To consider spectral variations caused by progenitor metallicity differences, we constructed a grid of model spectra of Type Ia supernova for metallicities from a thousandth to three times solar metallicity, using the W7 deflegration model, and spectral code PHOENIX. The grid covers days 8, 11, 14, 17, 21 post explosion because these effects should be most predominant in the early spectra. Variations are present in the spectra primarily in the UV as expected. We found an possible alternate identification for the feature that has been identified as the carbon 6580 observed in some normal type Ia. Our model spectra have a feature from carbon 6580 and a feature caused by a blend of silicon lines at 6690, 6667, and 6745. The carbon feature in the model is too slow and the silcon feature is at too low a velocity to match the observations. The fit of W7 to observations in this region of the spectra is poor so a better explosion model will be needed to better study these effects.\n",14,

Nance*,S. Nance*; J. Parrent; A. M. Soderberg,Sessioned,The University of Texas at Austin; Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): This is a preliminary report on the mass of remaining hydrogen envelopes for stars massive enough to explode under core collapse. Using the stellar evolution code, MESA, our initial findings suggest that a significant fraction of massive stars with M_ZAMS  = 20-60 Msun lose all but 10^-3 Msun -10^-1 Msun as they near eventual core collapse. This result is dependent on the mass-loss prescription, degree of rotation, metallicity, rates of nuclear burning in the core, and the final stellar configuration. Nevertheless, each of our test cases include a few stars that retain trace amounts of surface hydrogen, which would then be detected as faint H in type IIb/Ib/Ic supernova spectra. We also compare our findings to the progenitor candidate identified for iPTF13bvn using the most recent photometric corrections. We agree with the previous conclusion found by Groh et al. (2013) that the progenitor had an initial mass of 32 Msun, but now with an additional condition of 0.06 Msun of hydrogen on its surface just prior to the explosion. We demonstrate through our study that not all Type Ib supernovae are fully devoid of hydrogen at the time of explosion, which has implications for the nature of the progenitor star and thus provides impetus for a revised classification scheme for 'stripped envelope' supernovae.

Hristov*,B. Hristov*; D. C. Collins; P. Hoeflich; C. Weatherford,Sessioned,Florida A&M University; Florida State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The consistency of Type Ia SNe allows for simple descriptions of the phenomena founded on basic physics and yet no theory is able to explain the observations entirely. In particular we are addressing an outstanding problem with current 3D simulations, in which Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities bring too much burned material to the outer layers thus mixing iron group elements towards the surface but those are not observed. Additionally light curves are reproduced well only in spherically symmetric explosions, while they break down when instabilities are present. We attempt to explain these discrepancies by introducing magnetic fields, which affects the rate of growth of unstable modes. Specifically it increases the growth rate of modes parallel to itself and suppress the transverse modes. This reduces the mixing in two possible ways: stronger burning causes faster pre-expansion, then plumes rise with the similar speed as the surrounding material is expanding; and RT instabilities are suppressed so much that they don't rise at all. Our preliminary models run in a rectangular domain inside a C/O white dwarf (WD) extending 120km along the stellar radius and is about 15km on the side. External magnetic fields between 1e4G and 1e9G are superimposed at various angles to the WD radius. A simple two-species nuclear network is employed in the form of fuel-product (C/O -> 56Ni). The front propagation is modeled as diffusion of the burned fraction of the C/O fuel. All simulations were done with Enzo - a 3D AMR MHD code for astrophysical and cosmological imulations, which was enhanced with additional physics for the nuclear burning. Future work will extend to full star simulations and more complex nuclear networks.\n",16,

We use the FLASH code to perform multidimensional simulations in the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) explosion paradigm from progenitor models produced with the MESA stellar evolution code that include the thermal energetics of the Urca process. We performed a suite of DDT simulations over a range of ignition conditions and compare to previous results from a suite of C-O white dwarfs.

Nagaraj*,G. Nagaraj*; K. Scholberg,Sessioned,North Carolina State University; Duke University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Core collapse supernovae (SNe) are widely known to be among the universe's primary neutrino factories, releasing ∼99% of their energy, or ∼10<sup>53</sup> ergs, in the form of the tiny leptons. On the other hand, less than 4% of the energy of Type Ia SNe is released via neutrinos, hence making Ia SNe impossible to detect (through neutrino observations) at typical supernova distances. For this reason, neutrino signatures from these explosions have very rarely been modeled. We ran time-sliced fluences from non-oscillation pure deflagration and delayed detonation (DDT) Ia models by Odrzywolek and Plewa (2011) through SNOwGLoBES, a software that calculates event rates and other observed quantities of supernova neutrinos in various detectors. We determined Ia neutrino event rates in Hyper-K, a proposed water Cherenkov detector, JUNO, a scintillator detector under construction, and DUNE, a proposed argon detector, and identified criteria to distinguish between the two models (pure deflagration and DDT) based on data from a real supernova (statistically represented by a Poisson distribution around the expected result). We found that up to distances of 8.00, 1.54, and 2.37 kpc (subject to change based on oscillation effects and modified detector efficiencies), we can discern the explosion mechanism with ≥90% confidence in Hyper-K, JUNO, and DUNE, respectively, thus learning more about Ia progenitors.\n",18,

Along with the printed career brochure, there are supplementary videos available on Gemini’s website and Youtube pages that provide a more detailed and personal glimpse into the day-in-the-life of a wide assortment of Gemini employees. A weakness in most observatory’s outreach programming point to the notion that students (and teachers) feel there is a disconnect between academics and where students would like to end up in their career future.

We obtained sensitive X-ray grating observations with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating spectrometer (HETG) and the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) in 2013-2014. These observations provide information on the temperature and emission measure distribution of the X-ray emitting plasma, a prerequisite for distinguishing between very hot plasma arising in magnetically-confined regions (e.g. the corona) and much cooler plasma that could originate in accretion shocks or the shocked jet. The emission measure distribution is dominated by hot plasma with a characteristic temperature T ~ 50 MK (kT ~ 4 - 5 keV), but higher temperatures were recorded during flares. Emission from the Fe K complex (Fe XXV; 6.7 keV) arising in very hot plasma was detected, as well as fluorescent Fe emission at 6.4 keV from cold surrounding material irradiated by the hard X-ray source. Spectral lines tracing cool plasma at temperatures of a few MK such as O VIII (0.654 keV) are also present in the RGS spectrum.

France,Sessioned,University of Colorado at Boulder,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present empirically-derived fits to the ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves along the line of sight towards young stars with circumstellar disks.  Stellar UV radiation plays a strong role in heating the disk gas and driving chemical reactions.  Thus, it is important to measure the UV extinction curve in order to reconstruct the intrinsic UV flux irradiating the disk, thereby enabling accurate photochemical modeling of the planet-forming environment.  To measure the extinction, we first compare modeled H2 fluorescence spectra to observed H2 lines.  Lyman-alpha radiation from the stars pumps electronic transitions of H2 in the disk, and we model the flux that is re-emitted through the subsequent fluorescent cascade.  We then extract an initial extinction curve over the 1100-1700 Angstrom wavelength region from the difference between the modeled H2 fluorescence and the HST data.  To account for self-absorption in the disk by the optically thick H2, we divide this initial extinction curve by the transmission in each fluorescence line.  We then fit the resulting interstellar extinction curve with an interstellar reddening model characterized by an Av and Rv value.  The shape of the extinction curve allows us to characterize the dust grain distribution in the intervening material as well as to recover the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the stars over a wide wavelength range.\n",2,

Theory suggests that mass may periodically flow in an accretion stream from a circumbinary disk across the gap onto circumstellar disks or stellar surfaces.<br /><br />The archetype for this theory is the eccentric, PMS binary DQ Tau. Moderate-cadence broadband photometry (~10 observations per orbital period) has shown pulsed brightening events near most periastron passages, just as numerical simulations would predict for a binary of similar orbital parameters. While this observed behavior supports the accretion stream theory, it is not exclusive to variable accretion rates. Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during the collision of stellar magnetospheres at periastron (when separated by 8 stellar radii) could produce the same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. Further evidence for magnetic activity comes from gyrosynchrotron, radio flares (typical of stellar flares) observed near multiple periastron passages. To reveal the physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau’s moderate-cadence observations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multi-band photometry over 10 orbital periods (LCOGT 1m network), supplemented with 32 nights of minute-cadence photometry centered on 4 separate periastron passages (WIYN 0.9m; APO ARCSAT). With detailed lightcurve morphologies we distinguish between the gradual rise and fall on multi-day time-scales predicted by the accretion stream theory and the hour time-scale, rapid-rise and exponential-decay typical of flares. While both are present, accretion dominates the observed variability providing evidence for the accretion stream theory and detailed mass accretion rates for comparison with numerical simulations.\n",6,

Tan,Sessioned,University of Florida; University of Calgary,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present the results of large scale, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of disk winds for different initial magnetic field configurations. The jets are followed from the source to distances, which are resolvable by HST and ALMA observations. Our simulations show that jets are heated along their length by many shocks. The mass of the protostar is a free parameter that can be inserted in the post processing of the data, and we apply the simulations to both low mass and high mass protostars. For the latter we also compute the expected diagnostics when the outflow is photoionized by the protostar. We compute the emission lines that are produced, and find excellent agreement with observations. For a one solar mass protostar, we find the jet width to be between 20 and 30 au while the maximum velocities perpendicular to the jet are found to be 100 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The initially less open magnetic field configuration simulations result in a wider, two-component jet; a cylindrically shaped outer jet surrounding a narrow and much faster, inner jet. For the initially most open magnetic field configuration the kink mode creates a narrow corkscrew-like jet without a clear Keplerian rotation profile and even regions where we observe rotation opposite to the disk (counter-rotating). This is not seen in the less open field configurations.\n",7,

In particular, there is debate about whether or not the earliest disks are large and massive and about when and how disks form. To characterize the properties of the youngest disks and binaries we are conducting the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity survey (VANDAM) toward all known protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud (d ~ 230 pc). The survey is the largest and most complete high-resolution millimeter/centimeter wavelength survey of protostellar disks and binaries. We present the dust emission results toward a sample of ~15 protostellar disk candidates around Class 0 and I sources in the Perseus molecular cloud from the VANDAM survey with ~0.05'' or 12 AU resolution. We have begun to confirm the disk candidacy of these sources by fitting the Ka-band 8 mm dust-continuum data in the uv-plane to a simple, parametrized model based on the Shakura-Sunyaev disk model. The seven candidate disks this analysis has been performed on are well-fit by the disk shaped model, and have estimated masses from the measured flux in agreement with masses of previously known disks.  The inner-disk surface densities of the VANDAM candidate disks have shallower density profiles compared to disks around more evolved Class II systems.  The best-fit model radii of the seven early-result candidate disks are R > 10 AU; at 8 mm, the radii reflect lower limits on the disk size since dust continuum emission is tied to grain size and large grains radially drift inwards. These disks, if confirmed kinematically, are inconsistent with theoretical models where the disk size is limited by strong magnetic braking to < 10 AU at early times.\n",9,

Previous studies suggested that there are young stars in this region; Camargo et al. (2012) identified several few-Myr-old clusters in this region from 2MASS clustering, and Jose et al. (2008) identified H-alpha excess sources. Since stars form from clouds of interstellar dust and gas, a signature of star formation is excess infrared (IR) emission, which is interpreted as evidence for circumstellar dust around young stars. We identified new candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in IC 417 by incorporating near- and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Infrared excess sources were identified by using a series of color cuts in various 2MASS/WISE color-magnitude and color-color diagrams following Koenig & Leisawitz (2014). We also assembled a list of OB and H-alpha stars from the literature, including those from Jose et al. (2008), and H-alpha bright stars from the IPHAS survey (Witham et al. 2008). Starting with this compiled list of approximately 200 interesting objects in the region, we then set about checking their reliability in three ways. We inspected the POSS, 2MASS, and WISE images of the sources. We assembled and inspected spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from archival data ranging from wavelengths of 0.7 to 22 um. Finally, we created and inspected color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. We find enough new YSO candidates to more than double the number yet identified in the IC 417 region. This research was made possible through the NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program (NITARP) and was funded by NASA Astrophysics Data Program.\n",10,

Stellar mass dependent features of star formation (such as disk evolution, planet formation, and even the IMF) are fundamentally tied to these models, which implies a systematic uncertainty that can only be improved with precise measurements of calibrator stars. We will describe the discovery and characterization of ten eclipsing binary systems in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region from K2 Campaign 2 data, spanning from B stars to the substellar boundary. We have obtained complementary RV curves, spectral classifications, and high-resolution imaging for these targets; the combination of these data yield high-precision masses and radii for the binary components, and hence a dense sampling of the (nominally coeval) mass-radius relation of 10 Myr old stars. We already reported initial results from this program for the young M4.5 eclipsing binary UScoCTIO 5 (Kraus et al. 2015), demonstrating that theoretically predicted masses are discrepant by ~50% for low-mass stars. K2's unique radius measurements allow us to isolate the source of the discrepancy: models of young stars do not predict luminosities that are too low, as is commonly thought, but rather temperatures that are too warm.\n",12,

Constraints on stellar population ages are derived from probabilistic HR diagrams (pHRDs) generated by fitting stellar model spectra to the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Herbig Ae/Be stars and their less-evolved, pre-main sequence progenitors. Stellar samples for the pHRDs are selected based on the detection of X-ray emission associated with the IR source, and the <i>lack</i> of detectible IR excess emission at wavelengths ≤4.5 µm. The SED model fits were used to create two-dimensional probability distributions of the stellar parameters, specifically bolometric luminosity versus temperature and mass versus evolutionary age. We present first results from the pHRD analysis of the relatively evolved Carina Nebula and the unevolved M17 SWex infrared dark cloud, which reveal the expected, strikingly different star formation durations between these two regions.

Spitzer is the fourth and final space telescope in NASA's Great Observatory series. Originally it consisted of a liquid-helium-cooled 85-cm telescope and three imaging and spectroscopic instruments capable of observing infrared light (3-160 micron wavelength) from regions of space invisible to optical telescopes. In mid-2009 Spitzer’s cryogen was exhausted, leaving the observatory with two operating imaging arrays at 3.6 and 4.5 micron wavelength. “Warm” Spitzer, as it is now called, continues to match the sensitivity achieved at these wavelengths during the cryogenic mission and remains very much in demand. The Spitzer Space Telescope has changed our view of the Universe. Spitzer's scientific results include the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe, star formation and evolution, exoplanets, the structure and evolution of planetary disks around nearby stars, the cosmic distance scale, clusters of galaxies, near-Earth asteroids, and comets. After a brief description of the Spitzer mission, achievements of Spitzer's extragalactic and galactic observational programs will be presented, including many of Spitzer’s very spectacular images.\n",1,

Ashby,Sessioned,Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; California Institute of Technology; Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Thermal emission from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) can provide a significant contribution to the bolometric luminosity of galaxies, and its effect at infrared wavelengths can mimic the process of star-formation, jeopardizing star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics. It is therefore important to model the AGN emission and to quantify its effect on the estimated SFRs when SED fitting tools are applied. We tackle this problem by studying the dust radiative transfer calculations of hydrodynamically simulated binary galaxy mergers covering a broad range of parameters, including stellar mas ratios, gas contents, AGN luminosity and viewing angles. We apply the energy balance SED fitting codes CHIBURST and CIGALE to the mock SEDs of our simulated merger, and then compare with the results of applying the same codes to the SEDs of observed merging galaxies in the Local Universe. At different stages of the interaction, we compare their derived SFRs and AGN fractions with those predicted by the hydrodynamical simulations, for a broad range of the interaction parameters, but focus on the stages near coalescence, when the AGN contribution exceed 10% of the total luminosity. We show that the contribution to IR luminosity is greatest during and immediately after coalescence, when the two supermassive black holes of the interacting pair merge and undergo and enhanced period of accretion. Under certain conditions, CIGALE succeeds at recovering the SFRs and AGN fractions with higher accuracy than other available codes, such as MAGPHYS, even during these extreme stages.   Our results show that using the IR luminosity as a simple surrogate for star formation can significantly overestimate the true SFR by underestimating the contribution from the AGN. Finally, we study the effect of using different parametric star formation histories (SFHs) when fitting the SEDs of galaxies, and show that a delayed SFH is usually a reasonable choice for merging galaxies.\n",1,

Mushotzky,Sessioned,"University of Maryland, College Park","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present new results on the relationship of star formation to active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in an ultra-hard X-ray selected sample which show a significant difference in the star-forming properties of AGN hosts both in the star formation rate (SFR) and the location of the star formation. While the observed scaling relations between galaxies and the supermassive black holes (SMBH) they host as well as numerical simulations suggest a star formation AGN connection, popular methods for measuring the SFR of galaxies are routinely contaminated by emission related to the AGN. Further selection methods for constructing samples of AGN are often biased due to obscuration and host galaxy contributions. We selected over 300 AGN in the 14-195 keV energy range to be observed with the Herschel Space Observatory and study their star forming properties in the FIR( 70-500 μm) and allowing us to construct the most complete IR spectral energy distributions (SED) for a large, relatively unbiased sample of AGN. We used SED decomposition techniques to measure the dust temperatures, dust masses, SFR, and IR AGN fractions and compared them to non-AGN star-forming galaxies. The AGN host galaxies lie systematically below the main sequence of star formation primarily due to reduced levels of star formation. This is possibly the first direct indication of large scale AGN feedback affecting galaxies. The FIR morphology of AGN host galaxies are also more compact than normal star-forming galaxies which suggests either suggests a large portion of the FIR originates from the AGN or star-formation primarily occurs near the nucleus. In our analysis a significant fraction of the emission at 70 μm can be associated with the AGN and any estimates of the SFR based on it are overestimated. Finally, I will discuss our measured SFR-AGN correlation and put it in context with the current understanding of galaxy and SMBH growth.\n",2,

This is consistent with the secular evolution scenario, in which the nucleus and galaxy are fueled by the same gas supply at a relatively constant ratio.

IR luminous galaxies, which are massive and heavily dust obscured (L<sub>IR</sub> > 10<sup>11</sup> Lsun), dominate the stellar growth during this era, and many are harboring a hidden AGN. I have quantified the contribution of AGN heating to the infrared emission of 343 IR luminous galaxies from z=0.5-2.8 using Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy, available for every source, making this an unprecedented sample. I classify sources as star forming galaxies, AGN, or composites based on the presence of mid-IR continuum emission due to a dusty torus. My findings are: 1) Surprisingly, 60% of IR luminous galaxies show signs of some dust heating emanating from an AGN. I quantify the far-IR emission using deep Herschel imaging and find that the strength of mid-IR AGN emission is tightly correlated with the total contribution of an AGN to LIR, which has important consequences for calculating star formation rates in dusty high redshift galaxies. I demonstrate techniques to remove the contribution of AGN to LIR when mid-IR spectroscopy is available and when only limited photometry is available. 2) The composites are a separate class of galaxy which show a true mix of star formation and AGN activity in their mid- and far-IR emission. Because of dust obscuration, this activity is largely undetected at other wavelengths. This composite population is important for understanding galaxy evolution and makes up at least 30% of the deepest IR selected samples. I underscore the importance of considering composite galaxies separately in studies of star formation and black hole growth at high redshift.<br /><br />\n",4,

M. Jones*,K. M. Jones*; M. Lacy; D. Nielsen,Sessioned,University of Virginia; National Radio Astronomy Observatory; University of Wisconsin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) feedback is prescribed for driving the high-end shape of the galaxy luminosity function, clearing the circumnuclear environment during the end stages of mergers, and eventually turning off its own accretion. Yet the dominant processes and characteristics of active galactic nuclei are indistinct. Chief among this confusion is how significant the role of dust is in each galaxy. Orientation of the dusty torus is attributed to causing the differences between Sy1 and Sy2, but whether obscured quasars are found in particularly dusty host galaxies, if they exist at a different stage in the merger process (early on, before the dust is blown out), or if they are merely oriented differently than optical quasars is not yet so well distinguished. With obscured quasars now observed to make up 50% or greater of the population of quasars, the question of what causes obscuration becomes vital to address. With this in mind, I study matched samples of obscured and unobscured quasars to characterize their environments, with the intent of addressing what contribution environment has to obscuration levels. I investigate the megaparsec-scale environments of SIRTF Wide-field Infra-Red Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) quasars at z ∼ 1−3 by cross-correlating the sample with 3.8 million galaxies from the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS). Optically obscured quasars are compared to a control sample of optically-bright quasars via selection in the mid-infrared. Environments were observed at 3.6 and 4.5 μm to a depth of ≈ 2 μJy (AB = 23.1). Recent work has found diverse results in such studies, with dependence of environmental richness on both redshift and level of obscuration. I find that, within reasonable error, on average there is no distinct difference between the level of clustering for obscured and normal quasars, and that there is no dependence on redshift of this result within the range of 1.3 < z < 2.5. I compare our results with recent studies and investigate the role of selection criteria in the assessment of clustering. I also explore the large scale SED structure of obscured and unobscured quasar host galaxies.\n",6,

Therefore, the composition, morphology, and distribution of material in protoplanetary and debris disks are important for planet formation. Here we present the results of studies of two disk systems: AB Aur and AU Mic.<br /><br />The circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae star AB Aur has many interesting features, including spirals, asymmetries, and non-uniformities. However, comparatively little is known about the envelope surrounding the system. Recent work by Tang et al (2012) has suggested that the observed spiral armss may not in fact be in the disk, but instead are due to areas of increased density in the envelope and projection effects. Using Monte Carlo modeling, we find that it is unlikely that the envelope holds enough material to be responsible for such features and that it is more plausible that they form from disk material. Given the likelihood that gravitational perturbations from planets cause the observed spiral morphology, we use archival H band observations of AB Aur with a baseline of 5.5 years to determine the locations of possible planets.<br /><br />The AU Mic debris disk also has many interesting morphological features. Because its disk is edge on, the system is an ideal candidate for color studies using coronagraphic spectroscopy. Spectra of the system were taken by placing a HST/STIS long slit parallel to and overlapping the disk while blocking out the central star with an occulting fiducial bar. Color gradients may reveal the chemical processing that is occuring within the disk. In addition, it may trace the potential composition and architecture of any planetary bodies in the system because collisional break up of planetesimals produces the observed dust in the system. We present the resulting optical reflected spectra (5200 to 10,200 angstroms) from this procedure at several disk locations. We find that the disk is bluest at the innermost locations of the disk, and that it becomes increasingly gray in regions farther from the central star.\n",1,

With the conclusion of all major space infrared missions and lack of future large-scale infrared excess survey missions, it is time to make a complete list of all debris disk systems and search for trends in the population. A thorough search of the literature for infrared excess stars has been combined with a large-scale survey for excess stars in the Tycho-2 catalog that makes use of all available infrared photometry. The result is a list of ~580 unique high fidelity debris disk stars. This project seeks a comprehensive analysis of debris disk stars not yet completed on this large scale. A summary of the creation of the high fidelity debris disk census and the multi-facility endeavor to obtain various stellar and disk parameters for each debris disk will be presented.

La Plante*,P. La Plante*,Sessioned,Carnegie Mellon University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Helium reionization is an important epoch in the Universe’s history and the most recent large-scale transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Reionization is driven largely by quasars, and has important implications on the thermal history of the IGM. Numerical simulations are ideally suited to investigate this problem due to the highly biased nature of observed quasars and the large degree of photoheating expected from quasar spectral energy distribution measurements. Recently, we have run a new suite of large-scale cosmological simulations that solve N-body, hydrodynamics, and radiative transfer simultaneously in order to study the impact of helium reionization on the IGM. Running fully coupled simulations allows us to capture the crucial impact that reionization has on thermal properties of the gas, which in previous studies has been typically included only in post-processing. We have developed a model to include a quasar population in our simulations that accurately reflects observations from the most recent BOSS and SDSS measurements. Our model reproduces the quasar luminosity function and the two point correlation function, the two main observational constraints on the high-redshift quasar population. Using this model, we vary the timing of helium reionization in order to isolate key observable features that can provide insight to properties of helium reionization, such as its duration and timing. We make predictions for the temperature density relation of the IGM and synthetic measuements related to the Lyman-alpha forest, both for HI and HeII. We process our synthetic spectra to measure the effective optical depth, the flux PDF, and the one-dimensional flux power spectrum. We show that features of reionization are readily visible in the HeII Lyman-alpha forest spectra and in the temperature evolution of the mean-density IGM, and might be detectable in the HI forest as well.\n",2,

E. Aguirre*,J. E. Aguirre*,Sessioned,University of Pennsylvania,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Because of the extreme brightness of foreground emission relative to the desired signal, experiments seeking the 21 cm HI signal from the epoch of reionization must employ foreground removal or avoidance strategies with high dynamic range.  Almost all of these techniques rely on the spectral smoothness of the foreground emission, which is dominated by synchrotron emission.  The polarized component of such emission can suffer Faraday rotation through the interstellar medium of the Milky Way, thereby inducing frequency structure which can be mistaken for real reionization signal.  Therefore, it is of great importance for such experiments to eliminate leakage of Faraday-rotated, polarized emission into the unpolarized (Stokes I) component where the reionization signal lives.  We discuss a number of approaches under investigation for mitigating this leakage in the PAPER  and HERA experiments, including calibration and careful instrument design.  Importantly, however, we show that the ionosphere may provide a very strong suppression of the polarized signal, when averaged over the integration times required for EoR experiments, by scrambling the phase of polarized sources.  Moreover, this attenuation comes with very little suppression of the desired unpolarized signal.  We consider the implications of this strategy for PAPER and HERA.\n",3,

Datta,Sessioned,Univ. of Colorado at Boulder; UCLA; University College London,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The all-sky or global redshifted 21-cm HI signal is a potentially powerful probe of the first luminous objects and their environs during the transition from the Dark Ages to Cosmic Dawn (35 > z > 6). The first stars, black holes, and galaxies heat and ionize the surrounding intergalactic medium, composed mainly of neutral hydrogen, so the hyperfine 21-cm transition can be used to indirectly study these early radiation sources. The properties of these objects can be examined via the broad absorption and emission features that are expected in the spectrum. The Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) is proposed to conduct these observations at low radio astronomy frequencies, 40-120 MHz, in a 125 km orbit about the Moon. The Moon occults both the Earth and the Sun as DARE makes observations above the lunar farside, thus eliminating the corrupting effects from Earth’s ionosphere, radio frequency interference, and solar nanoflares. The signal is extracted from the galactic/extragalactic foreground employing Bayesian methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Theory indicates that the 21-cm signal is well described by a model in which the evolution of various physical quantities follows a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function of redshift. We show that this approach accurately captures degeneracies and covariances between parameters, including those related to the signal, foreground, and the instrument. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that MCMC fits will set meaningful constraints on the Ly-α, ionizing, and X-ray backgrounds along with the minimum virial temperature of the first star-forming halos.\n",4,

At low mass scales (~10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>), early-forming halos are predicted to be more strongly clustered than the late-forming ones. In this study we aim to robustly detect the signature of assembly bias observationally, making use of formation time indicators of central galaxies in low mass halos as a proxy for the halo formation history. Weak gravitational lensing is employed to ensure our early- and late-forming halo samples have similar masses, and are free of contamination of satellites from more massive halos. For the two formation time indicators used (resolved star formation history and current specific star formation rate), we do not find convincing evidence of assembly bias. We attribute the lack of detection to the possibility that these indicators do not correlate well with the halo formation history, and suggest alternatives that should perform better for future studies.  In addition, we have developed a method to constrain the probability distribution function of halo mass of a given galaxy sample, and also demonstrate that the abundance matching-based halo mass assignments to galaxy groups and clusters may be biased, likely due to interlopers from more massive galactic systems.\n",5,

Johnson*,Sessioned,University of Texas at Austin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Short-period planets around intermediate-mass (~1.5-2.5 M<sub>⊙</sub>; A-mid F type) stars are a largely unexplored region of parameter space. These stars' typically rapid rotation and rotationally broadened spectral lines preclude the use of the precise radial velocity measurements that are typically used to discover planets and confirm transiting planet candidates. Nonetheless, exploring this population is important for constraining models of planet formation and migration. I have been using Doppler tomography to investigate this population. As a planet transits a rotating star, it successively obscures regions of the stellar disk with different radial velocities, resulting in a perturbation to the rotationally broadened line profile; this is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In Doppler tomography, I spectroscopically resolve this perturbation and its movement during the transit. This allows me to not only validate transiting planet candidates, as I can show that the transiting object orbits the target star and is not a blended background eclipsing binary, but also to measure the spin-orbit misalignments of these planets. This is the (sky-projected) angle between the stellar spin and planetary orbital angular momentum vectors, and is a statistical probe of planetary migration; different migration mechanisms predict different distributions of spin-orbit misalignments. In this dissertation talk I will discuss my work to validate Kepler planet candidates around rapidly rotating stars using Doppler tomography, and to measure the spin-orbit misalignments of hot Jupiters discovered by ground-based surveys. I will also discuss the use of Doppler tomography to provide additional characterization of planets and their host stars, such as the detection of planetary orbital precession and stellar differential rotation. Finally, I will highlight the potential of current and future missions such as K2 and TESS to expand our knowledge of planets around intermediate-mass stars.\n",1,

Observational biases in exoplanet discovery have long left the frequency, properties, and provenance of planets in most binary systems largely unconstrained. Recent results from our ongoing survey of a volume-limited sample of Kepler planet hosts indicate that binary companions at solar-system scales of 20–100 AU suppress the occurrence of planetary systems at a rate of 30–100%. However, some planetary systems do survive in binaries, and determining these systems' orbital architectures is key to understanding why. As a demonstration of this new approach to testing ideas of planet formation, we present a detailed analysis of the triple star system Kepler-444 (HIP 94931) that hosts five Ganymede- to Mars-sized planets. By combining our high-precision astrometry with radial velocities from HIRES we discover a highly eccentric stellar orbit that would have made this a seemingly hostile site for planet formation.  This either points to an extremely robust and efficient planet formation mechanism or a rare case of favorable initial conditions.  Such broader implications will be addressed by determining orbital architectures for our larger statistical sample of Kepler planet-hosting systems that have stellar companions on solar system scales.<br />\n",2,

For GJ 1214b, I measured an unprecedentedly precise near-infrared transmission spectrum that definitively reveals the presence of clouds in the planet’s atmosphere.  For WASP-43b and WASP-12b, I also obtained very precise spectra. These exhibit water features at high confidence (>7 sigma).  The retrieved water abundance for WASP-43b extends the well-known Solar System trend of decreasing atmospheric metallicity with increasing planet mass.  The detection of water for WASP-12b marks the first spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the planet’s atmosphere and implies that it has solar composition, ruling out carbon-to-oxygen ratios greater than unity.  For WASP-103b, I will present preliminary results from the new technique of phase-resolved spectroscopy that constrain the planet’s temperature structure, dynamics, and energy budget. Taken together, these results provide a foundation for comparative planetology beyond the Solar System and the investigation of Earth-like, potentially habitable planets with future observing facilities.\n",7,

While these telescope concepts would also be capable of conducting a broad range of astrophysical investigations, the most difficult technology challenges are driven by the requirements for imaging exo-earths. The exoplanet science yield for these mission concepts will drive design trades and mission concept comparisons.<br /><br />To assist in these trade studies, the Exoplanet Exploration Program Office (ExEP) is developing a yield estimation tool that emphasizes transparency and consistent comparison of various design concepts. The tool will provide a parametric estimate of science yield of various mission concepts using contrast curves from physics-based model codes and Monte Carlo simulations of design reference missions using realistic constraints, such as solar avoidance angles, the observatory orbit, propulsion limitations of star shades, the accessibility of candidate targets, local and background zodiacal light levels, and background confusion by stars and galaxies. The python tool utilizes Dmitry Savransky’s EXOSIMS (Exoplanet Open-Source Imaging Mission Simulator) design reference mission simulator that is being developed for the WFIRST Preliminary Science program. ExEP is extending and validating the tool for future mission concepts under consideration for the upcoming 2020 decadal review. We present a validation plan and preliminary yield results for a point design.\n",1,

Together with the results from Kepler, TESS, and PLATO, WFIRST will complete the statistical census of planets in the Galaxy. These expectations are based on the most basic and conservative assumptions about the data quality, and assumes that the analysis methodologies will be similar to that used for current ground-based microlensing. Yet, in fact, the data quality will be dramatically better, and information content substantially richer, for the WFIRST microlensing survey as compared to current ground-based surveys. Thus WFIRST should allow for orders of magnitude improvement in both sensitivity and science yield. We will review some of these expected improvements and opportunities (the ""known unknowns""), and provide a ""to do list"" of what tasks will need to be completed in order to take advantage of these opportunities. We will then speculate on the opportunities that we may not be aware of yet (the ""unknown unknowns""), how we might go about determining what those opportunities are, and how we might figure out what we will need to do to take advantage of them.<br /><br />This work was partially supported by NASA grant<b> </b>NNX14AF63G.\n",2,

LSST will collect several hundred multi-band photometric observations of approximately one billion stars, while a small portion of the sky (around 100 square degrees) will be observed around ten thousand times. LSST was not designed to detect exoplanets; however, we have demonstrated that several kinds of transiting exoplanets can be recovered in simulated LSST observations. This includes exoplanets around host stars that have not been frequently targeted by transiting planet searches, such as the galactic bulge, star clusters, nearby red dwarfs, and even the Large Magellanic Cloud. For high-cadence fields, the expected detection rates are a significant improvement over the regular-cadence fields and provide a strong incentive to consider exoplanet detections in choosing LSST's high-cadence fields. We continue to investigate questions that still remain for quantifying planet yields using current detection methods, comparing detection methods to find those that will be most efficient, and examining how to incorporate false positives.\n",3,

The majority of LSST light curves will contain about 1000 data points (so-called regular cadence) while select fields will have 10000 data points (deep-drilling cadence). Lund et al. (2015) demonstrated that several configurations of exoplanetary systems could be recovered using LSST in areas currently underrepresented in planet searches; i.e. the galactic bulge, the Magellanic clouds, and nearby red dwarfs.  A fundamental question in working with LSST data is how time-sensitive detection of transient phenomena will affect the rate and type of expected scientific discoveries. Specifically, we aim to examine how quickly significant science results be achievable over the course of LSST’s ten-year mission.  We apply a methodology established in Jacklin et al.

Here, we conduct a similar analysis on a yearly basis in order to examine the rate of detection over the course of the LSST mission.

The unprecedented sensitivity of NIRCam on the JWST provides direct access to this population of gas-giants. A NIRCam 3 - 5 μm survey for such planets will place critical constraints on planet formation by: 1) measuring the luminosities of young, sub-Jupiter mass planets, 2) providing constraints on the peak in the companion surface density vs. separation distribution, and 3) measuring the frequency of ≤Jupiter mass giants in the outskirts of these systems (>10 AU).

NIRISS aperture masking interferometry (AMI) will provide an order of magnitude better contrast than ground-based aperture masking and be able to observe stars a few orders of magnitude fainter than from the ground. This will enable the detection of young jovian planets at the highest resolution available to JWST at the near-IR wavelengths to follow up GAIA planet detections around nearby M dwarfs within 30pc.

In the last major review (Lawson, JPL D-72279, 2013), the control of scattered sunlight from the edges of the starshade into the telescope was identified as one of the key technology development areas in order to make the starshade feasible. Modeling of the scattered light has resulted in very different results (Casement et al., SPIE Vol. 8442, 4H, 2012, Martin et al., SPIE Vol. 8864, 88641A, 2013) so a campaign of experimentation with edge samples was undertaken to attempt to resolve the discrepancies.<br /><br />Here, we present our latest results from both modeling efforts and measurement of samples of materials which would be suitable for manufacturing the starshade edge. We have focused on coating metallic samples for ease of fabrication, including measuring the sharpness of an edge that can be fabricated using standard machine shop methods of a variety of materials that are suitable for space application. We then had these samples coated by two suppliers to evaluate how well these coating types would conform to the edge and provide scatter suppression. The results of scatter measurements of these coated edge samples are presented. In addition, we have subjected these samples to a limited set of environments to evaluate their durability and followed up by remeasuring a portion of these exposed samples to compare the scatter suppression before and after environmental exposure.\n",7,

We find that, if they house planets, globular clusters provide ideal environments for advanced civilizations that can survive over long times. We therefore propose methods to search for planets in globular clusters. If planets are found and if our arguments are correct, searches for intelligent life are most likely to succeed when directed toward globular clusters.

These seven observations cover the wavelength range 1150-10,270 Å with 0.2 and 0.5 arcsec wide slits, and are co-spatial to within 0.1 arcsec along a 25 arcsec length across each nebula. The wavelength and spatial coverage enabled a detailed study of physical conditions and abundances from UV and optical line emissions (compared to only optical lines) for these seven PNe. The first UV lines of interest are those of carbon. The resolved lines of C III] 1906.68 and 1908.73 yielded a direct measurement of the density within the volume occupied by doubly-ionized carbon and other similar co-spatial ions as well as contributed to an accurate measurement of the carbon abundance. Each PN spectrum was divided into smaller spatial regions or segments in order to assess inferred density variations among the regions along the entire slit. There is a clear difference in the inferred density for several regions of each PNe. Variations in electron temperature and chemical abundances were also probed and shown to be completely homogeneous within the errors. Lastly, these nebulae were modeled in detail with the photoionization code CLOUDY. This modeling constrained the central star parameters of temperature and luminosity and tested the effects different density profiles have on these parameters.

We present 16 years of Chandra ACIS observations of SN 1987A, covering 4600 -10500 days after the supernova. The X-ray emission traces the progress of the blast wave and functions as a probe of the CSM. About 4000 days after the explosion, the blast wave began interacting with a dense equatorial ring created by winds of the progenitor. With Chandra, we are able to resolve this ring and monitor how it changes over time. Changes in the size and morphology of the ring and changes in the X-ray light curve reveal several turning points in the evolution of this newborn supernova remnant which indicate it may now be entering a new era in its evolution. A sudden drop in the radial expansion velocity of the ring from 7200 km/s to 1900 km/s and corresponding upturn in the soft X-ray light curve indicated the onset of interaction with the full equatorial ring at day 6000. At approximately day 7500, the east-west asymmetry of the ring began to reverse, while the spectra and soft X-ray light curve revealed that the increase in soft X-ray emission slowed dramatically. This suggests the average CSM density encountered by the blast wave decreased at this time, likely due to either a density gradient in the outer parts of the ring or the blast wave exiting the ring in the east. Since day 9700 the soft X-ray light curve has flattened and remained approximately constant, evidence that the blast wave has now left the dense material of the known equatorial ring and is beginning to probe the unknown territory beyond.\n",2,

The high spatial resolution of these instruments allows for accurate measurements of the proper motion of the forward shock in Tycho, with baselines now at 15 years for the X-ray data and 30 years for the radio. Type Ia SNe are of fundamental importance in astrophysics, yet the nature of their environments and progenitor systems is poorly understood. In a recent work, we have shown that the<br />ISM surrounding Tycho varies systematically in density by a factor of 5, with larger excursions in some locations. A substantial density variation is consistent with limited previous proper motion studies that have been done in radio and X-rays. Our expanded baseline measurements allow us to further explore the variations in the dynamics of the shock wave, which can also be used to localize the explosion site. Previous proper motion measurements, made over much shorter time baselines, have shown some discrepancies in the shock<br />velocity as measured in radio and X-rays.

These observations revealed broad molecular lines toward nineteen remnants, including nine newly identified associations between molecular clouds and remnants. Morphology of the molecular emission suggests molecular shocks can arise at large separations from the remnants, consistent with a scenario where high-velocity ejecta from bipolar outflows or fast-moving knots shocks nearby molecular clouds. Also, broadened 12CO J=2-1 line emission should be detectable toward virtually all supernova remnant/molecular cloud interactions and, therefore, the total number of observed interactions is low. This result favors predictions that SN feedback plays little or no role in star formation over short timescales. In addition, we find no significant association between TeV gamma-ray sources and molecular cloud interactions, contrary to predictions that supernova remnant/molecular cloud interfaces are the primary venues for cosmic ray acceleration.\n",4,

Sjouwerman,Sessioned,The University of New Mexico; National Radio Astronomy Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Astronomical masers are useful probes of the physical conditions of the gas in which they are formed. Masers form under specific physical conditions and therefore, can be used to trace distinct environments. In particular, collisionally excited 36 and 44 GHz methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and 1720 MHz hydroxl (OH) masers are found associated with shocked gas produced by the interaction between supernova remnants (SNRs) and molecular clouds (MCs). The overall goal of my thesis research is to combine modeling and observations to characterize the properties and formation of CH<sub>3</sub>OH masers in these SNR/MC interaction regions. More accurate information of the density (and density gradients) could, for example, be used as inputs or constraints for models of SNR cosmic ray acceleration. In this talk, I will present results from calculations of the physical conditions necessary for the occurence of 36.169, 44.070, 84.521, and 95.169 GHz CH<sub>3</sub>OH maser lines near SNRs, using a coupled radiative transfer and level population code. The modeling shows that given a sufficient CH<sub>3</sub>OH abundance, CH<sub>3</sub>OH maser emission arises over a wide range of densities and temperatures, with optimal conditions at n ~ 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> and T > 60 K, overlapping with masing conditions for OH masers. Furthermore, the 36 and 44 GHz transitions display more significant maser optical depths compared to the 84 and 95 GHz transitions over the majority of the physical conditions. The line intensity ratios between multiple transitions significantly change with altering physical conditions and can be used to constrain the physical parameters of the gas where CH<sub>3</sub>OH masers are detected. I use the modeling results as a diagnostic tool to interpret the observational results of a sample of SNRs with previous and recent CH<sub>3</sub>OH maser detections (G1.4-0.1, W28, Sgr A East, G5.7-0.0, W44 and W51C). I will also discuss the close spatial and kinematic correlation of CH<sub>3</sub>OH masers and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub> (3,3)) emission peaks, which is a reliable method for locating CH<sub>3</sub>OH masers and may help determine the density structure in SNRs.

Elwood*,B. Elwood*; J. Murphy; M. Diaz,Sessioned,Florida State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Previous literature regarding size distributions of supernova remnants generally discuss a uniform distribution for the radius, occasionally considering a Gaussian alternative. We indeed show that these distributions are consistent with log-normal, which can be considered a natural consequence of the Central Limit Theorem and Sedov expansion. Modeling explosion energy, remnant age, and ambient density as independent, random distributions, we show, using simple Monte Carlo simulations, that the size distribution is indistinguishable from log-normal when the SNR sample size is of order three hundred. This implies that these SNR distributions provide only information on the mean and variance, yielding additional information only when the sample size grows large. We then proceed to Bayesian statistical inference to characterize the information provided by the size distributions. In particular, we use the mean and variance of sizes and explosion energies to subsequently estimate the mean and variance of the ambient medium surrounding SNR progenitors. This in turn allows us to characterize potential bias in studies involving samples of supernova remnants.\n",7,

Cosmological simulations allow us to study in detail the evolution of galaxies' halos in cluster environments and have shown that the formation of extended halos around central cluster galaxies and intracluster light (ICL) is closely correlated to the morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters. However, the extremely low surface brightness of these components makes it difficult to gather observational constraints. Planetary nebulas (PNs) offer a unique tool to investigate these environments owing to their strong [OIII] emission line. I will present a study of the light and stellar motion in the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 and its surrounding IC component at the centre of the Virgo cluster, prime targets to shed light on the hierarchical assembly of structure in the Universe. We make use of a deep and extended PN sample (~ 300 objects) to study out to ~150 kpc in radius M87. We show that at all distance the galaxy halo overlap with the<br />Virgo ICL. However, they are dynamically distinct components with different density profiles, and parent stellar<br />populations, consistent with the halo of M87 being redder and more metal rich than the ICL. Moreover, the synergy between PN kinematical information and deep V/B-band photometry made it possible to unveal an ongoing accretion process in the outskirt of M87, that has caused a non-negligible modification of the halo properties. The ongoing assembly of this galaxy at distances R>60 kpc is also shown by the overall PN halo kinematics, reflecting the dynamical complexity of a still growing system.<br />\n",2,

Jeong et al. later studied galaxies with unexpectedly strong Na D absorption lines (Na D excess objects: NEOs) and showed that the origins of NEOs are different for different types of galaxies. According to their study, the origin of Na D excess seems to be related to interstellar medium (ISM) in late-type galaxies, but there seems to be no contributions from ISM in smooth-looking early-type galaxies. In order to test this finding, we measured the Doppler components in Na D lines of NEOs. We hypothesized that if Na D absorption line is related to ISM, the absorption line is more likely to be blueshifted in the spectrum by the motion of ISM caused by outflow. Many of late-type NEOs show blueshifted Na D absorption lines, so their origin seems related to ISM. On the other hand, smooth-looking early-type NEOs do not show Doppler departure and Na D excess in early-type NEOs is likely not related to ISM, which is consistent with the finding of Jeong et al.\n",5,

Within each 3 degree diameter pointing of the 2.5m Sloan Telescope, we deploy 17 hexagonal fiber bundles with sizes ranging from 12 to 32 arcsec in diameter. The bundles are build with 2 arcsec fibers and have a 56% fill factor. During observations, we obtained sets of exposures at 3 different dither positions to achieve near-critical sampling of the effective point spread function, which has a FWHM about 2.5 arcsec, corresponding to 1-2 kpc for the majority of the galaxies targeted. The flux calibration is done using 12 additional mini-fiber-bundles targeting standard stars simultaneously with science targets, achieving a calibration accuracy better than 5% over 90% of the wavelength range. The target galaxies are selected to ensure uniform spatial coverage in units of effective radii for the majority of the galaxies while maximizing spatial resolution. About 2/3 of the sample is covered out to 1.5Re (primary sample) and 1/3 of the sample covered to 2.5Re (secondary sample). The sample is designed to have approximately equal representation from high and low mass galaxies while maintaining volume-limited selection at fixed absolute magnitudes.

Belfiore*,Sessioned,Cambridge University; Kavli Institute for Cosmology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We study the spatially resolved excitation properties of the ionised gas in local galaxies by exploiting the first year of data collected by the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Based on the spatial distribution of the line ratios we identify 5 classes of galaxies. 1) star forming galaxies; 2) galaxies in which the central few/several kpc are characterised by LINER-like (or LIER) emission, but star formation is occurring in the outer disc (`central LIER', or cLIER); 3) galaxies in which line emission is LINER-like throughout the whole galaxy extent, without evidence for star formation (`extended LIER', or eLIER); 4) passive (line-less) galaxies; 5) a small fraction of merging/interacting galaxies with peculiar line emission.<br /><br />In cLIER and eLIER galaxies LIER emission is associated with old stellar populations and low equivalent width of line emission. This strongly supports the scenario where LIER emission in these galaxies is associated with ionisation by hot, evolved stars, disfavoring models associating LIER emission with shocks. Some contribution to the nuclear LIER emission by a weak AGN cannot be excluded by our data.<br /><br />Except for the common excitation mechanism, cLIERs and eLIERs do not appear to be part of a continuous population. cLIERs are morphologically late types, are mostly located in the green valley, tend to have younger stellar populations (though older than SF galaxies) and have regular gaseous and stellar rotation patterns. These results are in line with a scenario in which SF galaxies are quenched `inside-out', with the central regions producing stars more efficiently and thus exhausting their molecular gas supply sooner.<br /><br />eLIERs are morphological early types, have older stellar populations (indistinguishable from passive) and for most of them the ionised gas either does not show a rotation pattern or the rotation axis is strongly misaligned (or even counter-rotating) relative to the stellar component. These features indicate that eLIERs are likely to be passive galaxies that have re-acquired some gas (either by accretion or stellar mass loss), but this gas is prevented from forming stars, possibly as a consequence of the hard radiation field produced by evolved stars.\n",3,

Cheung*,E. Cheung*; K. Bundy,Sessioned,"Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe,","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the last 10 billion years (i.e., since redshift z ~2) the number of quiescent galaxies with little to no ongoing star formation has grown by a factor ~25. This is challenging to understand since galaxy formation models predict that these galaxies will continue to accrete fresh gas over their lifetimes, relatively little of which is required to reignite measurable star formation. It is thought that feedback from fresh gas accreting onto a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) might help such galaxies maintain their quiescence, but observational evidence for such ``maintenance mode feedback'' remains sparse. Using novel imaging spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey (Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV: Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), we present evidence for a new maintenance mode phenomenon we term ``red geysers,'' a potentially episodic but relatively low-power AGN driven wind present in typical quiescent field galaxies of moderate mass and spheroidal morphology. We examine an archetypal red geyser that appears to be accreting gas from a low-mass companion but has no corresponding star formation. Instead, we find evidence for a galaxy-scale ionized wind with outflow velocities reaching more than 300 km/s and high velocity dispersions. We also detect a narrow biconical pattern of strong emission line equivalent widths consistent with fast shocks. Given additional confirmation of a radio AGN present in the galaxy, we propose that red geysers such as this may be a common mode in which gas accretion activates an ionized wind feedback mechanism that prevents star formation and helps moderate luminosity quiescent galaxies maintain their quiescence.\n",4,

Westfall*,K. Westfall*; M. A. Bershady,Sessioned,University of Portsmouth; University of Wisconsin-Madison,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In its first year alone, the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey has provided kinematic data useful for determining the rotation curves of both the ionized-gas and stellar components for hundreds of disk galaxies.  We use these data to study the well-known Tully-Fisher relation in the local Universe, as well as the difference between the ionized-gas and stellar rotation curves in a novel study of asymmetric drift.  The physical scenario for the latter is that gas efficiently dissipates energy allowing it to settle toward the circular speed of the galactic potential, whereas the stellar ensemble orbits more slowly because stars are collisionless and retain any non-circular motions accrued over their dynamical history.  In disk galaxies with line-of-sight velocity dispersions that are well-measured with MaNGA's moderate spectral resolution, we demonstrate the correlation between asymmetric drift and stellar velocity dispersion, as expected by the dynamical relation between the two via the stellar phase-space distribution function.  This correlation is consistent with measurements obtained at higher spectral resolution by the DiskMass Survey, and it allows us to leverage asymmetric drift to provide stellar velocity dispersion estimates that probe well below the instrumental dispersion.  These velocity dispersion measurements can then be used to estimate the dynamical mass surface density of the baryon-dominated disk (Bershady et al. 2010, 2011).  Thus, by combining our circular-speed data --- which yield a well-defined Tully-Fisher relation that is consistent with literature studies --- and our measurements of asymmetric drift, we discuss the implications for the dark-matter mass fractions of our galaxy sample.  Statistically, our results are consistent with previous claims (e.g., Martinsson et al. 2013) that dark matter is a significant, even dominant, mass component within the effective radius of disk galaxies.<br />\n",5,

Analyses of both a dozen galaxies observed by the MaNGA prototype run (P-MaNGA) and ~700 galaxies in the current MaNGA sample have shown that the SFH gradients are useful for understanding disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies. We find the SFH gradient of a galaxy to strongly depend on the evolution stage of its central region. Centrally star-forming galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variations. In contrast, centrally quiescent galaxies present significant radial gradients in the sense that D<sub>n</sub>(4000) decreases, while both EW(Hδ<sub>A</sub>) and EW(Hα) increase from the galactic center outward. This effect is seen mainly for high-mass galaxies with stellar mass above a few ×10<sup>10</sup> M⊙, and depends weakly on galaxy morphology type. These results are consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formation propagates from the center of a galaxy outward as it moves to the red sequence. In this talk I will present these analyses and discuss their implications on galaxy evolution.\n",6,

M. Diamond-Stanic*,A. M. Diamond-Stanic*,Sessioned,University of Wisconsin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The efficiency of star formation in galaxies is regulated by the cycle of accretion and feedback processes in the circumgalactic medium. The geometry, kinematics, and multi-phase structure of circumgalactic gas are not well predicted by numerical simulations, so there is motivation to characterize these properties empirically by observing ionized gas around galaxies in both emission and absorption. Absorption-line studies are quite sensitive to diffuse gas at low column densities, but they are limited in scope because they require bright background sources, which are rare and offer pencil-beam probes of gas properties for individual galaxies. A complementary approach is to use optical emission lines to study extraplanar diffuse ionized gas, which can trace the spatial extent and kinematics of outflowing and inflowing gas. Using the unique dataset of spatially resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), we are developing techniques to identify galaxies with extraplanar gas on the basis of optical emission lines that extend above and below the plane of disk galaxies. Our initial results suggest that extraplanar gas is quite common among galaxies in the MaNGA sample, particularly among star-forming galaxies with inclination angles greater than 45 degrees, for which it is more straightforward to separate extraplanar gas from emission associated with the disk. These results on the incidence, geometry, and kinematics of extraplanar gas as a function of global galaxy properties provide important constraints on models of accretion and feedback in the circumgalactic medium.\n",7,

To address these questions, we have been developing novel techniques to extract the various structural components from integral field unit (IFU) spectral observations of galaxies, in order to study simultaneously their spectral and spatial properties.<br /><br />As a first approach, by spatially decomposing each wavelength in a spectral data cube, we can discover how much light comes from the separate components as a function of wavelength, and hence derive unprecedentedly high quality spectra of bulge and disk for detailed analysis of their stellar populations.<br /><br />In addition, we have decomposed spectral data cubes by fitting the spectrum at each location with the sum of two components, with the spectral properties left entirely free to fit both kinematic and stellar population properties, subject only to the constraint that the relative flux contributions match those of a conventional bulge–disk decomposition.<br /><br />Initial results applied to MaNGA and other IFU surveys show the power of these techniques when applied to such high quality data. The first method allows us to understand the formation sequence of bulges and disks, with, for example, bulges showing the younger stellar populations in S0 galaxies, implying that this was where the last gasp of star formation occurred. The second technique reveals subtle population gradients within individual components, but also confirms that the decomposition into separate components is a credible procedure, as the resulting bulges and disks have entirely plausible kinematic properties that are in no way imposed by the decomposition.<br /><br />Although our initial application of these decomposition techniques has been to studying bulges and disks in S0 galaxies, the methods have much wider application to the spectral data cubes that MaNGA and other surveys are producing, wherever there are multiple galaxy components. Possible subjects include separating spiral arms from underlying disks, studying multiple nuclei in giant ellipticals, and simply separating line-of-sight superpositions of galaxies.\n",9,

Rubin*,Sessioned,Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Current models of galaxy formation require that the buildup of galactic stellar mass proceeds at a rate much slower than the rate at which gas is accreted onto dark matter halos. The implementation of winds in these models, however, has been primarily via <i>ad hoc</i> prescriptions, as the relationship between outflow morphology and kinematics and star formation activity is not well understood. In addition, empirical evidence for the inflow of gas onto star-forming galaxies has remained elusive. To address these issues, we analyze absorption line profiles for the NaI λλ5890, 5896 transition in spatially-resolved spectroscopy of nearby galaxies observed in the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey. We identify outflows of cool (T~10<sup>2</sup> K) gas via the blueshift of the absorption lines. Initial results suggest that in systems in which outflows are detected, the equivalent width of the flow varies significantly over the surface of the galaxy, revealing a changing flow covering fraction/velocity within individual objects. We also measure the incidence of redshifted NaI absorption in this sample for constraints on the frequency and cross section of cool gas accretion. This analysis offers unique insight into the morphology, surface density, and velocity of cool inflow and outflow around nearby galaxies. Accurate estimates of these quantities are fundamental to understanding the role of gas flows in regulating galaxy growth.\n",10,

However, radio surveys capable of providing matched resolution gas data for a large fraction of the MaNGA sample are a decade or more away.  We are therefore exploring a new technique for obtaining maps of the total gas content directly from the MaNGA data.  Following the method outlined in Brinchmann et al. 2013, we use the dust optical depth and the nebular metallicity measured from optical emission lines to estimate the total gas surface density in individual spaxels.  We combine this with estimates of the stellar mass in each spaxel to produce spatially resolved estimates of the gas mass fraction.  We compare trends in the global gas mass fraction with stellar mass and NUV-r color to those found in the literature. We explore how the radial gas mass fraction gradients of MaNGA galaxies correlate with other properties such as total stellar mass, specific star formation rate (SFR/M*), concentration, and environment.\n",11,

Does the interstellar medium gas density threshold for star formation change at low metallicity?

We use dust-based molecular gas maps based on the HERITAGE <i>Herschel</i> data (Meixner et al. 2013) to evaluate molecular gas depletion times as a function of spatial scale. We compare galaxy-scale analytic star formation models to our observations and find that successfully predicting the trends in the low metallicity data requires the inclusion of a diffuse neutral medium. However, the analytic models do not capture the scatter observed, which computer simulations suggest is driven primarily by the time-averaging effect of star formation rate tracers. The averaging of the scatter in the molecular gas depletion time as a function of scale size suggests that the drivers of the star formation process in these galaxies operate on large scales. Analyzing mid-IR spectroscopy from <i>Spitzer</i> in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), we find that the modeling of the mid-infrared H<sub>2</sub> line emission gives temperatures, column densities, and fractions of warm H<sub>2</sub> that are similar to nearby galaxies. On small (~ few pc) scales in the SMC, we study the effect of metallicity on the structure of photodissociation regions using [CII] and [OI] spectroscopy combined with new ALMA ACA maps of <sup>12</sup>CO and <sup>13</sup>CO.

Rathborne,Sessioned,Boston University; Leiden Observatory; Yale University; Universidad de Chile; National Astronomical Observatory of Japan; CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In an survey of 53 galaxies, Gao & Solomon (2004) found a tight linear relationship between the infrared luminosity (a proxy for the star formation rate) and the HCN(1–0) luminosity, which is known as the Gao & Solomon relationship. Wu et al. (2005, 2010) found that this relationship extends from these extragalactic sources to the much less luminous Galactic clumps (~1 pc scales), and posited that there exists a fundamental unit for the ratio between infrared luminosity and dense gas mass for high-mass star-forming clumps. The luminosities of the Gao & Solomon (2004) galaxies could then be explained as a summation of this fundamental unit in the form of high-mass star-forming clumps. We test this explanation and other possible origins of the Gao-Solomon relationship using high-density tracers (including HCN(1–0), N2H+(1–0), HCO+(1–0), HNC(1–0), HC3N(10–9), and C2H(1–0)) for ~400 Galactic clumps from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) survey. Along with ancillary data, we find that this fundamental unit is not likely to exist at the clump-scale. Specifically, there are not enough high-mass clumps in the Milky Way to achieve the total expected luminosity of the Galaxy. Extended infrared emission, which often lacks high-mass clumps, adds significant (and probably dominant) emission to the total infrared luminosity of a galaxy. Low-mass clumps appear to add a significant, if not dominant, component to a galaxy’s total HCN(1–0) luminosity. We suggest that Gao & Solomon relationship could be a result of a universal large-scale star formation efficiency, initial mass function, clump mass function, and core mass function. The power-law slope of the Gao & Solomon relationship probably depends on the critical density of the tracer and the median density of the galaxy, as suggested in theoretical simulations.\n",3,

For instance, intrinsic ultraviolet (UV) emission from young stars is an excellent tracer of the SFR. Observed UV luminosities, however, have been strongly attenuated by intervening interstellar dust. Since emission from hot dust is readily available from IRAS, Spitzer, and WISE, it is common practice to combine mid-IR emission (around 25 μm) with observed UV in order to obtain an SFR diagnostic of the form L<sub>obs</sub>(FUV) + a<sub>corr</sub><b> </b>×<b> </b>L<sub>obs</sub>(25 μm). Conventionally, a single correction a<sub>corr</sub>, previously determined for a sample of galaxies, is used. Here we test the reliability of this hybrid SFR diagnostic, allowing for a variable correction factor a<sub>corr</sub>. For this, we have performed broadband UV-to-IR SED fittings in order to model the star formation histories across the spiral galaxy NGC6946. We have obtained SFRs and stellar masses across the galaxy, from physical scales of 5 kpc down to 500 pc. We find that a<sub>corr</sub><b> </b>varies significantly across the galaxy and increases with increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR), the ratio of SFR and stellar mass (or the ratio of young and old stars). The correction a<sub>corr</sub> does not seem to be correlated to the amount of attenuation A<i><sub>V</sub></i>. Variation of a<sub>corr</sub> is most likely caused by different mixes of young and old stellar populations across the galaxy. This finding agrees well with our previous results for the interacting spiral galaxy NGC 6872, for which we have demonstrated the variation of a<sub>corr</sub> and a its correlation with sSFR. Our results show the need of caution when using only two broadband filters in order to determine SFR of individual galaxies or sub-galactic regions. The dust emission most likely overestimates SFR for highly star-forming, high sSFR regions, and underestimates it for more quiescent, low sSFR regions.\n",4,

We highlight an overlooked yet potentially significant source of feedback -- Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. While a massive star cluster is expected to have cleared out before the WR phase, we have identified an emerging cluster, S26 in NGC 4449, that hosts a substantial population of evolved WRs and shows signs of ongoing feedback. We follow up this significant discovery with an observational survey to search for more sources undergoing this evolutionary phase. We obtain optical spectra of a sample of radio-selected targets (characteristics chosen to identify those early in their evolution) to look for WR signatures; we term successful detections as 'emerging WR clusters'.

Heitsch,Sessioned,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Starburst driven superbubbles can produce large scale galactic outflows. Whether any given starburst can create an outflow depends on several variables including the rate at which energy and mass are injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), the radiative cooling prescription used, and the overall density distribution of the ISM. We investigate the effect that two different temperature floors in our radiative cooling prescription have on wind kinematics and content. We find that cooling to 10 K instead of to 10<sup>4</sup> K increases the mass fraction of cold neutral and hot X-ray gas in the galactic wind while halving that in warm Hα. For sufficiently powerful starbursts our cooling prescription does not affect the terminal velocity of gas within the superbubble. Filaments embedded in the hot galactic wind contain warm and cold gas which moves slower than the surrounding wind, with the coldest gas hardly moving with respect to the galaxy. Optically bright filaments form at the edge of merging superbubbles and if anchored to a star forming complex will persist and grow to > 400 pc in length. These filaments are the main source of warm and cold gas being transported into the galactic halo. Using synthetic absorption profiles we measure the velocity of the warm and hot gas phases and find v<sub>warm</sub> ∝ v<sub>hot</sub><sup>0.5</sup>. We also find that v<sub>hot</sub> ∝ SFR<sup>0.5</sup>, which implies v<sub>warm</sub> ∝ SFR<sup>0.25</sup>.

In the case of NGC 253 we decomposed the unresolved hard X-ray emission between background, unresolved binaries and truly diffuse flux and found that the diffuse flux upper limit is marginally above model predictions for inverse-Compton scattering of IR photons by cosmic rays.\n",4,

Yoast-Hull*,T. Yoast-Hull*; J. S. Gallagher; E. G. Zweibel,Sessioned,University of Wisconsin-Madison,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Magnetic fields in starburst galaxies are difficult to measure because of the density of the environments and the high degree of turbulence found in the fields. Because direct measurement of the magnetic field strength is not possible, it is often assumed that the energy densities in magnetic fields and cosmic rays are equal. Thus, the non-thermal radio synchrotron spectrum for a galaxy allows indirect estimates to be made of the magnetic field strength. However, the relationship between cosmic rays and the observed non-thermal emission from galaxies is complex. Both primary and secondary cosmic rays contribute to the total emitted synchrotron spectrum, and to accurately model the cosmic-ray electron populations, a variety of energy losses, including bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton emission, must be accounted for in the calculations. While classical equipartition formulae largely ignored these intricacies, there have been several recent revisions to the formulae to account for the intense conditions in starbursts. Yet, the application of the equipartition formula to starburst environments also presupposes that the timescales are long enough for the starburst regions to have reached equilibrium. Here, we test this assumption of equilibrium in nearby starburst galaxies by modeling both the observed gamma-ray spectrum, which provides a direct probe of the cosmic ray energy density, and the radio spectrum, which provides a probe of the magnetic field strength. We find that for each galaxy tested, the magnetic field energy density is significantly larger than the cosmic ray energy density, demonstrating that the equipartition argument is frequently invalid for central molecular zones.\n",5,

RESOLVE is surrounded by the ~10x larger Environmental COntext (ECO) catalog, with matched custom photometry and environment metrics enabling analysis of cosmic variance with greater statistical power. For the ~1500 galaxies in its two equatorial footprints, RESOLVE goes beyond ECO in providing (i) deep 21cm data with adaptive sensitivity ensuring HI mass detections or upper limits <10% of the stellar mass and (ii) 3D optical spectroscopy including both high-resolution ionized gas or stellar kinematic data for each galaxy and broad 320-725nm spectroscopy spanning [OII] 3727, Halpha, and Hbeta. RESOLVE is designed to complement other radio and optical surveys in providing diverse, contiguous, and uniform local/global environment data as well as unusually high completeness extending into the gas-dominated dwarf galaxy regime. RESOLVE also offers superb reprocessed photometry including full, deep NUV coverage and synergy with other equatorial surveys as well as unique northern and southern facilities such as Arecibo, the GBT, and ALMA.

In the first results from ECO, we study the phenomenon of galaxy disk growth by considering by-eye and quantitative morphological classifications as well as galaxy environments quantified using group identifications and halo abundance matching (on integrated r-band luminosity) as well as smoothed galaxy density fields. Additionally, we derive HI gas masses and upper limits from ALFALFA data and HI mass estimates from the photometric gas fraction technique. We find that blue early-type (E/S0) galaxies, gas-dominated galaxies, and UV-bright disk host galaxies all become distinctly more common below group halo mass ∼10^11.5 Msun, implying that this low group halo mass regime may be a preferred regime for significant disk growth activity. We also find that blue early-type and blue late-type galaxies inhabit environments of similar group halo mass at fixed baryonic mass, consistent with a scenario in which blue early types can regrow late-type disks. More generally, we argue that the traditional morphology-environment relation (i.e., that denser environments have more early types) can be largely attributed to the morphology-galaxy mass relation for centrals and the color-environment relation for satellites.

First, we present optimized methods of stellar and gas mass estimation based on newly reprocessed multi-wavelength imaging, deep fractional mass-limited 21cm data, and a probability density field approach to the photometric gas fractions technique. Second, we examine the stellar and baryonic mass functions for RESOLVE and ECO, including an analysis of how galaxy mass functions vary between distinct, physically motivated group halo mass regimes. These “conditional” mass functions display complex substructure suggesting that the galaxy population is shaped through satellite destruction and merging during the process of multiple-occupancy group formation. Third, we present the group-integrated stellar and baryonic mass functions and examine the cold baryon fraction of groups as a function of group halo mass. We find that group halo mass measurements based on abundance matching and dynamical mass estimates sometimes disagree, pointing to the existence of a wide range of cold baryon fractions in groups at intermediate halo mass.

Specifically, we use a combination of Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF), and abundance matching techniques to connect mock galaxies to halos and we adopt different assumptions of how observable properties correlate with the properties of the underlying halos. We use the resulting mock catalogs to assess systematic errors in environmental metrics, such as errors in the inferred masses of galaxy groups that are due to group over-merging or fragmentation. We also use the mock catalogs to compare to an interesting trend that we find for galaxies that live in the 10% lowest density environments in ECO and RESOLVE. In the observations, we find that, at fixed stellar or baryonic mass, these galaxies in low density regions are bluer, more star forming, and more gas rich than galaxies residing in higher density environments.

A key strength of the 21cm observational program is its fractional mass limited design, which yields an unbiased inventory of atomic gas mass, with either clean detections or strong upper limits <5-10% of stellar mass. We combine this gas census with metrics that parameterize environment from group scales (group dark matter halo mass) up to large-scale structure (mass density of the cosmic web and classification into filaments, walls, and voids) to investigate the influence of small and large-scale environment on galaxy gas content. We show that satellites in groups down to 10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> have lower gas fractions compared to centrals at similar stellar mass, suggesting that group processes that deplete gas content are active well below the large group/cluster scale. In addition, at fixed halo mass both centrals and satellites in large-scale walls have systematically lower gas fractions than galaxies in filaments or voids, and this trend cannot be fully explained by differing stellar mass distributions within these large-scale environments. Lastly, we show that the abundance of gas-poor (gas-to-stellar mass ratio < 0.1) low halo-mass (<10<sup>11.4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) centrals increases with large-scale structure density, and that these centrals tend to reside closer to the outskirts of >10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> groups than do more gas-rich but otherwise analogous low halo-mass centrals, suggesting that the gas-poor centrals have lost their gas in flyby interactions with the nearby groups. We discuss how the observed trends may be shaped by a number of physical processes such as gas stripping, starvation, and halo assembly bias.

We search for CCGs offset to higher or lower dispersion in the dispersion-stellar mass relation, which may indicate tidal stripping or dissipative formation, respectively.

These surveys, therefore, provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the complete large–scale environments of low-redshift AGN and nuclear starbursts in such galaxies, in order to search for external triggering, examine activity in relation to gas supply, and investigate the role of feedback. By data-mining multi-wavelength catalogs that use varied techniques, we identify known AGN in RESOLVE and ECO, including a population of gas-dominated low-mass galaxies. We take advantage of these surveys' multi-wavelength supporting data to investigate triggering, feedback, and the roles of environment and gas supply in this initial sample of active galaxies. Because biases in standard AGN candidate selection techniques (e.g. BPT, X-ray luminosity) make them individually poor selectors of AGN activity in star-forming and low mass (<10^10 Msun) host galaxies, we also seek to improve the identification of nuclear activity in such galaxies via combined analysis of star formation and AGN signatures.

Whilst such parameterizations are useful for feeding classification algorithms, they are not effective at describing the underlying type of variability in the sources or the physical mechanism(s) for it. In this talk, we will discuss new approaches, such as wavelet variance, random matrix theory and echo state networks, that can provide insight into the science of variability rather than just statistically characterizing it. We will pay particular attention to sources exhibiting stochastic variation and how much information about the host system can be determined from their time series. For example, characteristic restframe timescales have been identified in quasars, potentially related to the size of coherent noise fields in the accretion disk.

Most have been detected and characterized using transit and/or radial velocity time series, and these techniques have undergone huge improvements in instrumental precision. However, the improvements in precision have brought to light new statistical challenges in detecting and characterizing exoplanets in the presence of correlated noise caused by stellar activity (transits and radial velocities) and gaps in the time sampling (radial velocities). These challenges have afflicted many of the most interesting exoplanets, from Earth-like planets to planetary systems whose orbital dynamics place important constraints on how planetary systems form and evolve. In the first part of the talk, I will focus on the problem of correlated noise for characterizing transiting exoplanets using transit timing variations. I will present a comparison of several techniques using wavelets, Gaussian processes, and polynomial splines to account for correlated noise in the likelihood function when inferring planetary parameters. I will also present results on the characteristics of correlated noise that cause planets to be missed by the Kepler and homegrown pipelines despite high nominal signal-to-noise.

ZTF is the successor to the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). The discovery engine for ZTF is a 47 square degree camera (realized through 16 e2V monolithic CCDs) that fills the entire focal plane of the 48-inch Oschin telescope of the Palomar Observatory. Single 30-s epoch sensitivity is about 20.5 in g and R bands. The Infarared Processing & Analysis Center (IPAC) is the data center for ZTF. ZTF is a public-private partnership with equal contributions from a consortium of world-wide partners and an NSF MSIP grant. Forty percent of ZTF time is set aside for two major community surveys: a 3-day cadence survey of high latitudes (to mimic LSST) and a time domain survey of the entire Northern Galactic plane. We expect first light in February 2017 and begin a 3-year survey starting summer of 2017. The first year will be spent on building up deep reference images of the sky (a must for transient surveys). During the second year IPAC will deliver near archival quality photometric products within 12 hours of observations. By comparison to reference images photometric alerts will be sent out. Year 3 will see the near real-time release of image differencing products. A Community Science Advisory Committee (CSAC), chaired by S. Ridgway (NOAO), has been set up to both advise the PI and to ensure that the US community's interests are well served. Astronomers interested in getting a head start on ZTF may wish to peruse the data releases from PTF.

Zhang*,H. Zhang*; M. Boettcher; H. Li,Sessioned,Ohio University; Los Alamos National Laboratory; North-West University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Blazars are active galactic nuclei whose jets are directed very close to our line of sight. They emit nonthermal-dominated emission from radio to gamma-rays, with the radio to optical emissions known to be polarized. Both radiation and polarization signatures can be strongly variable. Observations have shown that sometimes strong multiwavelength flares are accompanied by drastic polarization variations, indicating active participation of the magnetic field during flares. We have developed a 3D multi-zone time-dependent polarization-dependent radiation transfer code, which enables us to study the spectral and polarization signatures of blazar flares simultaneously. By combining this code with a Fokker-Planck nonthermal particle evolution scheme, we are able to derive simultaneous fits to time-dependent spectra, multiwavelength light curves, and time-dependent optical polarization signatures of a well-known multiwavelength flare with 180 degree polarization angle swing of the blazar 3C279. Our work shows that with detailed consideration of light travel time effects, the apparently symmetric time-dependent radiation and polarization signatures can be naturally explained by a straight, helically symmetric jet pervaded by a helical magnetic field, without the need of any asymmetric structures. Also our model suggests that the excess in the nonthermal particles during flares can originate from magnetic reconnection events, initiated by a shock propagating through the emission region. Additionally, the magnetic field should generally revert to its initial topology after the flare. We conclude that such shock-initiated magnetic reconnection event in an emission environment with relatively strong magnetic energy can be the driver of multiwavelength flares with polarization angle swings. Future statistics on such observations will constrain general features of such events, while magneto-hydrodynamic simulations will provide physical scenarios for the magnetic field evolution; both can be tested against our model, obtaining further constraints on the particle acceleration mechanism, as well as magnetic field structure and evolution inside the blazar emission region.\n",1,

We then analyze the color variability properties on short and long timescales, as compared to the length of an average gamma-ray flare, to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for the variability properties that we observe. By monitoring several activity states, we avoid the selection effects that previous studies have encountered when only observing blazars during flaring states. From this long-term observational data, we develop a schematic representation of the possible color variability behaviors in blazars and how it is related to the thermal disk and non-thermal jet contributions in both Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and BL Lac objects.\n",2,

We choose a set of input parameters for the leptonic model and the lepto-hadronic model to reproduce the broadband spectral energy distributions to the FSRQs 3C 273, 3C 279 respectively. Once we have been able to reproduce the broadband SEDs, we apply perturbations to different input parameters in the form of a Gaussian function of time in order to simulate flaring scenarios to distinguish the leptonic and lepto-hadronic models. We then apply both models to reproduce the broadband SED of the FSRQ 3C 454.3, and then apply a combination of perturbations to both models to reproduce a prominant flare that 3C 454.3 exhibited in Nov. 2010. Our results show that perturbations to any one input parameter can generate observational signatures that represent distinct differences between the leptonic and lepto-hadronic models.

However, there are apparent X-ray weak exceptions to this rule that are now providing novel insights, including weak-line quasars (WLQs) and especially analogs of the extreme WLQ, PHL 1811. We have been systematically studying such X-ray weak quasars with Chandra and near-infrared spectroscopy, and I will report results on their remarkable properties and describe implications for models of the accretion disk/corona and emission-line formation. We have found evidence that many of these quasars may have geometrically thick inner accretion disks, likely due to high accretion rates, that shield the high-ionization broad line region from the relevant ionizing continuum. This model can explain, in a simple and unified manner, their weak lines and diverse X-ray properties. Such shielding may, more generally, play a role in shaping the broad distributions of quasar emission-line equivalent widths and blueshifts.\n",4,

Richards,Sessioned,"University of Wisconsin, Madison; Australian Astronomical Observatory; University of California at Berkeley","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Quasar host galaxies (QHGs) represent a unique stage in galaxy evolution that can provide a glimpse into the relationship between an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) and its host galaxy. However, observing the hosts of high luminosity, unobscured quasars in the optical is complicated by the large ratio of quasar to host galaxy light. One strategy in optical spectroscopy is to use offset longslit observations of the host galaxy. This method allows the centers of QHGs to be analyzed apart from other regions of their host galaxies. But light from the accreting black hole’s point spread function still enters the host galaxy observations, and where the contrast between the host and intervening quasar light is favorable, the host galaxy is faint, producing low signal-to-noise (S/N) data. This stymies traditional stellar population methods that might rely on high S/N features in galaxy spectra to recover key galaxy properties like its star formation history (SFH). In response to this challenge, we have developed a method of stellar population modeling using diffusion k-means (DFK) that can recover SFHs from rest frame optical data with S/N ~ 5 Å^−1. Specifically, we use DFK to cultivate a reduced stellar population basis set. This DFK basis set of four broad age bins is able to recover a range of SFHs. With an analytic description of the seeing, we can use this DFK basis set to simultaneously model the SFHs and the intervening quasar light of QHGs as well. We compare the results of this method with previous techniques using synthetic data and find that our new method has a clear advantage in recovering SFHs from QHGs. On average, the DFK basis set is just as accurate and decisively more precise. This new technique could be used to analyze other low S/N galaxy spectra like those from higher redshift or integral field spectroscopy surveys.<br /><br />This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no.

The nature of the periodic minima seen in several spectral features are associated with periastron passages near stellar conjunction, but its nature has been interpreted either as a low excitation event or as an eclipse of the hotter secondary star by the dense inner wind of the primary. We conducted an intense spectroscopic monitoring of the He II λ4686 emission line across the 2014.6 event using ground- and space-based telescopes. Comparison with results from the past two events confirmed the stability of the equivalent width and radial velocity of this line, as well as the strict periodicity of its minima. In combination with different other measurements, the orbital period is 2022.7 (±0.3) d. We adopted a power law model in combination with the total opacity in the line of sight to the apex of the wind-wind collision region obtained from hydrodynamic simulations to reproduce the observed He II λ4686 equivalent width curve. We constrained the orbital inclination to 135°–153° and the longitude of periastron to 234°–252°. Periastron passage occurred on T<sub>0</sub>(2014.6)=2456874.4 (±1.3) d. With these orbital elements, we successfully reproduced both the equivalent width curve observed from our direct view of the central source and the polar view. This suggests that the He II λ4686 minimum is ultimately caused by an increase in the opacity in the line of sight to the emitting region as the secondary star moves behind the primary star and plunges into denser regions of its wind.\n",1,

The appearance of the transient is viewing angle-dependent due to vastly different optical depths parallel and perpendicular to the binary plane.

INTEGRAL discoveries of new classes of lower-luminosity HMXBs, some highly obscured and some showing extreme transient activity, as well as the recent discovery of the very quiescent and only known Be-BH binary, have considerably changed our understanding of clumping in massive stellar winds and the relative importance of different binary evolutionary channels. In order to better characterize the low-luminosity HMXB population, we have performed a survey of a square degree region in the direction of the Norma spiral arm with Chandra and NuSTAR. These surveys, combined with optical and infrared spectroscopic follow-up of the counterparts of hard X-ray sources, have yielded three HMXB candidates to date. Future radial-velocity follow-up of these candidates, as well as other Be HMXB candidates from the NuSTAR serendipitous survey, will help determine whether these sources truly are HMXBs and, if so, constrain the mass of the compact object in these systems. If confirmed, these HMXB candidates could extend our measurement of the HMXB luminosity function by about two orders of magnitude and provide important constraints on massive binary evolutionary models. In addition, the colliding wind binaries and pulsar wind nebulae discovered in the Norma X-ray survey will help shed light on other aspects of massive stellar evolution and massive stellar remnants. Finally, these surveys provide the opportunity to compare the hard X-ray populations in the Galactic disk and the Galactic Center. While the dominant hard X-ray populations in both of these Galactic regions appear to be cataclysmic variables (CVs), those in the Norma survey tend to have lower plasma temperatures than those in the Galactic Center, suggesting that the white dwarfs in Galactic Center CVs may have typical masses and/or magnetic field strengths that are higher than those of white dwarfs in the disk.\n",5,

GLASS has three primary science drivers although a wide variety of other science investigations are possible with the public GLASS data (e.g. SN 'Refsdal'). The key science goals of GLASS are to: 1) shed light on the epoch of reionization, by measuring the lyman alpha optical depth at z>6; 2) Study gas accretion, star formation, and outflows by spatially mapping resolved star formation and determine metallicity gradients from emission lines of galaxies at 1.3<z<2.3. 3) Explore the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution using the first comprehensive census of spatially resolved star formation in dense environments, i.e., the cluster cores as well as the cluster infall regions.

Thanks to their extended baseline of observations, wide-field ground-based photometric and spectroscopic surveys that have been monitoring the sky for years can provide robust constraints on transiting planets, supernova events, or other transient phenomena that have been newly identified in K2 data. I will discuss the opportunities for synergistic activities between the K2 space mission and such long-running ground-based surveys as HATNet, KELT, SuperWASP, and APOGEE that will maximize the scientific output from these surveys. In particular, I will present results from a search for transient phenomena in K2 data and will use ground-based survey data to aid the characterization of these phenomena.

What emerged from this review is a 5400 hour project to survey the 33885 square degrees of the sky above Declination -40 degrees from 2-4 GHz at 2MHz frequency resolution and 2.5"" angular resolution. Over the survey duration of 7 years, each area of the sky will be covered in 3 epochs spaced 32 months apart, to a depth of 0.12mJy/beam rms noise per epoch (0.07mJy/beam combined) in total intensity (Stokes I) and including full polarization. Observations are planned to commence in mid-2016. The raw data will be available in the NRAO archive immediately with no proprietary period and science data products will be provided to the community in a timely manner.<br /><br />In this presentation we describe the survey design and the Technical Implementation Plan (TIP) for the VLASS. The VLASS Basic Data Products (BDP) that will be produced by the survey team include: raw and calibrated visibility data, quick-look continuum images, single-epoch images and spectral image cubes, single-epoch basic object catalogs, and cumulative ""static sky"" images and image cubes and basic object catalogs to the full survey depth. Calibration, image processing, and analysis for the VLASS will be carried out through automated pipelines being developed at NRAO. Integral to this workflow is maintaining Quality Assurance throughout the system from telescope to archive. The storage and archive services budgeted for the BDP is 1PB for the data and images combined. Significantly higher storage would be required to serve the highest spectral resolution spectral cubes over the full sky area, and thus devising an affordable strategy for providing these services is critical, for example through ""Processing on Demand"" based on user query of the archive.

Although galaxy mergers play an important role, the direction of change in the amount of rotation depends on many merger parameters such as mass ratio, orbital parameters, and relative direction of galaxy rotations. Furthermore, all their merger parameters themselves are results of non-linear galaxy formation and evolution processes. By compiling numerous galaxy merger events, we discuss statistical properties of the evolution of early type galaxy rotation.

J. Daniel*,K. J. Daniel*; R. F. Wyse,Sessioned,Johns Hopkins University; Swarthmore College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Spiral galaxy evolution is frequently considered in the context of environment, but internal processes may also play an important role. Radial migration is one such internal process, wherein a transient spiral arm rearranges the angular momentum distribution of the disk around corotation without causing kinematic heating. The efficiency of radial migration depends on both the duty cycle for transient patterns and the RMS change in orbital angular momentum induced by each pattern. Should radial migration be efficient, it could cause a substantial fraction of disk stars to move large radial distances over the lifetime of the disk, thus having significant impact on its kinematic, structural and chemical evolution.<br /><br />In this talk, I will summarize a subset of work focusing on the physics that determines the magnitude of the RMS change in orbital angular momentum from each spiral pattern. I have derived an analytic “capture criterion” that predicts whether or not a disk star with finite random orbital energy is in a “trapped orbit” (i.e. the orbital family induced by the spiral pattern that can lead to radial migration).  I will present this criterion and show that it is primarily a star's orbital angular momentum that determines whether or not it is in a trapped orbit.  The capture criterion could be used to better understand the role of radial migration in N-body simulations as well as applied to models of galaxy evolution. I will describe an example study wherein I applied the capture criterion, in a series of disk galaxy models, to find the fraction of an ensemble of stars that is in trapped orbits. I found that this fraction decreases linearly with increasing radial velocity dispersion and conclude that radial migration may play a role in the evolution of disk galaxies, but it is insignificant to the evolution of high velocity dispersion populations.\n",2,

Two versions are used, one based on a Kennicult-like subgrid model (Gadget, Springel & Hernquist 2003); the other based on the new Feedback In Realistic Environments model (FIRE, Hopkins et al. 2014). Although the total star formation in galaxy encounters is generally elevated relative to isolated galaxies, we find that this elevation is a combination of intense enhancements within the central kpc and moderately suppressed activity at large galacto-centric radii. This effect appears to be stronger in the older Gadget model. Suppression is the disk is also found in the FIRE runs, but at larger scales. This is because tidal torques are weaker in the newer FIRE model, leading to a more extended nuclear starburt. Our predictions of the radial dependence of triggered star formation, and specifically the suppression of star formation beyond kpc-scales, will be testable with the next generation of integral-field spectroscopic surveys.\n",3,

Corlies*,L. Corlies*; D. Schiminovich,Sessioned,Columbia University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The circumgalactic medium (CGM) remains one of the least constrained and poorly understood components of galaxies. Theoretically, this is because predicted properties of such gas vary with key fundamental physical processes being debated in galaxy formation and evolution --- how do galaxies accrete gas and how does feedback work to remove it? Observationally, we have been limited to quasar absorption studies that probe individual galaxies with only one or a few lines of sight, providing an incomplete view of the CGM’s distribution. Deep imaging studies of the gas in emission, can map the underlying spatial distribution of the CGM and allow the gas density and temperature to be estimated. I present observationally constrained emission predictions from a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy and demonstrate how this emission reflects the evolution of the CGM at late times and discuss the detection likelihoods for such emission. The simulation is matched to current observational constraints by showing that varying the extragalactic UV background can help bring the predictions into better agreement with recent data. The emission is less sensitive to such variations but its structure is strongly shaped by the underlying gas density and temperature. From z=1 to z=0, the average density of the gas decreases while the average temperature increases, trends governed by the supernova feedback and the decrease of filamentary accretion. Observationally, we conclude that with moderate resolution and reasonable detection limits, future instrumentation should place constraints of the physical properties of the CGM.\n",4,

However, it is far from clear to what extent different numerical techniques and different implementations of feedback yield different results. The Scylla Multi-Code Comparison Project seeks to address this issue by running idenitical initial condition simulations with different popular hydrodynamic galaxy formation codes. Here we compare simulations of a Milky Way mass halo using the codes <i>enzo, ramses, art, arepo </i>and <i>gizmo-psph</i>. The different runs produce galaxies with a variety of properties. There are many differences, but also many similarities. For example we find that in all runs<i> cold flow disks</i> exist; extended gas structures, far beyond the galactic disk, that show signs of rotation. Also, the angular momentum of warm gas in the halo is much larger than the angular momentum of the dark matter. We also find notable differences between runs. The temperature and density distribution of hot gas can differ by over an order of magnitude between codes and the stellar mass to halo mass relation also varies widely. These results suggest that observations of galaxy gas halos and the stellar mass to halo mass relation can be used to constarin the correct model of feedback.\n",6,

Observations of these dusty belts offer a window into the physical and dynamical properties of planetesimals in extrasolar systems through the size distribution of dust grains.  In particular, the millimeter/radio spectral index of thermal dust emission encodes information on the grain size distribution that can be used to test proposed collisional models of planetesimals. We have made sensitive Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations of a sample of 7 nearby debris disks at 9 mm and combine these with archival Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of 8 additional debris disks at 7 mm.  Using measurements at (sub)millimeter wavelengths from the literature, we place tight constraints on the millimeter spectral indices and thus grain size distributions of this sample of debris disks.  Our analysis gives a weighted mean for the slope of the power-law grain distribution that is close to the classical prediction for a steady-state collisional cascade (q=3.5), but not consistent with the steeper distributions predicted by recent models that include more complex fragmentation processes.  To interpret this result, we explore the effects of material strengths, velocity distributions, and small-size cutoffs on the steady-state grain size distribution.\n",2,

In disks, the ratios of volatile elements (e.g., C/O) is regulated by the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at different distances from the central star. We explore the effects of dynamical processes, such as radial drift of solids and viscous gas accretion onto the central star, molecular compositions, and the ice morphology of dust grains in disks on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers in a protoplanetary disk, and their consequences for the C/O/N ratio in gas and dust throughout the disk. We find that radial drift and accretion alone can reduce the snow line radii by 40–60% of the main C and O carriers, i.e. H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub> and CO, compared to static disks, substantially changing the disk regions where C/O is enhanced over the stellar value. A similar effect is seen for the major nitrogen carriers. We note that N/O enhancements in disk gas can be even more extreme than C/O in the outer disk due to the low volatility of N<sub>2</sub> compared to all major C and O carriers. I will discuss these results together with the effects of additional dynamical processes, and outline a path toward a coupled drift-desorption-chemistry model that will provide robust quantitative results for volatile snowline locations and C/N/O abundance ratios as the disk evolves in time.\n",3,

Many are in systems with tightly packed inner planets. Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) has been proposed to explain these systems. It involves sequential in situ planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zone inner boundary (DZIB). Pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which builds up a ring, and then a planet. The planet is expected to grow until it opens a gap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce DZIB retreat that sets the location of formation of the next planet. The supply rate of pebbles is critical in this model as it sets the formation timescale of each planet. We present a model that describes the behavior of pebbles at the disk midplane, including pebble formation, growth and simple pebble-pebble interactions. The disk is divided into thin rings, in which different sub-populations of pebbles of varying sizes are modeled. In this way, we estimate the pebble supply rate to the inner disk, for given global disk properties. We then also focus on the dynamics of pebble supply to a protoplanet in the vicinity of a disk gap edge, which is being opened up once the planet reaches a critical gap opening mass. Utilizing hydro simulations of this process, we assess how the rate of pebble accretion varies as the planet approaches this mass and discuss implications for the formation of the next pebble ring and protoplanet.\n",4,

Nonetheless, the only source of information for the dynamics on the small, turbulent scales which control the accretion flow comes from the history of our own Solar System. The meteoritical record includes chondrites, mixtures of thermally unprocessed matrix and glassy, melted matrix. It is still unknown what mechanism heated to chondrule precursors to the 1700K temperature required to make chondrules. However, their size and composition tells us a lot about the environment in which chondrules formed, and chondrites were assembled. In particular, we show that the volatile depletion commonly (but not universally) seen in chondrules argues that they must have spent a prolonged, orbital-scale period at elevated temperatures around 1000K. This is in significant tension with chondrule cooling estimates of hours to days from laboratory studies, although those studies probe a different temperature scale. Intriguingly, the 1000K temperature scale would allow for sufficient thermal ionization of alkali metals to allow the magneto-rotational instability to act. This argues for a magnetic heating mechanism for chondrule formation. Further, the matrix was not processed at 1000K, which argues for a spatial separation between the chondrule forming, and the chondrite assembly regions.<br />\n",5,

We first divvy up planets into categories that are based on current observables, and that should impact the spectra we hope to observe in the future. The two main classification parameters we use here are the size of a planet and the energy flux into the planet's atmosphere. These two parameters are measureable or inferable from present-day observations, and should have a strong influence on future spectroscopy observations from JWST, WFIRST (with a coronagraph and/or starshade), and concept flagship missions that would fly some time after WFIRST. This allows us to calculate ""η<sub>planet</sub>"" values for each kind of planet. These η values then allow calculations of the expected yields from direct imaging missions, by leveraging the models and prior work by Stark and colleagues (2014, 2015). That work estimated the yields for potentially Earth-like worlds (i.e. of a size and stellar irradiation consistent with definitions of the habitable zone) for telescopes with a variety of observational parameters. We will do the same thing here, but for a wider variety of planets. This will allow us to discuss the implications of architecture and instrument properties on the diversity of worlds that future direct imaging missions would observe.\n",1,

Hu*,Sessioned,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Future direct-imaging exoplanet missions such as WFIRST will measure the reflectivity of exoplanets at visible wavelengths. Most of the exoplanets to be observed will be located further away from their parent stars than is Earth from the Sun. These “cold” exoplanets have atmospheric environments conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like Jupiter in the Solar System. I find the mixing ratio of methane and the pressure level of the uppermost cloud deck on these planets can be uniquely determined from their reflection spectra, with moderate spectral resolution, if the cloud deck is between 0.6 and 1.5 bars. The existence of this unique solution is useful for exoplanet direct imaging missions for several reasons. First, the weak bands and strong bands of methane enable the measurement of the methane mixing ratio and the cloud pressure, although an overlying haze layer can bias the estimate of the latter. Second, the cloud pressure, once derived, yields an important constraint on the internal heat flux from the planet, and thus indicating its thermal evolution. Third, water worlds having H<sub>2</sub>O-dominated atmospheres are likely to have water clouds located higher than the 10<sup>-3</sup> bar pressure level, and muted spectral absorption features. These planets would occupy a confined phase space in the color-color diagrams, likely distinguishable from H<sub>2</sub>-rich giant exoplanets by broadband observations. Therefore, direct-imaging exoplanet missions may offer the capability to broadly distinguish H<sub>2</sub>-rich giant exoplanets versus H<sub>2</sub>O-rich super-Earth exoplanets, and to detect ammonia and/or water clouds and methane gas in their atmospheres.\n",2,

This instrument, commissioned in 2011, is designed to search for Rayleigh scattering from short-period exoplanets due to the polarized nature of scattered light. Since these planets are spatially unresolvable from their host stars, the relative contribution of the planet-to-total system polarization is expected to vary with an amplitude of order 10 parts per million (ppm) over the course of the orbit. Non-zero and also variable at the 10 ppm level, the inherent polarization of the Lick 3-m telescope limits the accuracy of our measurements and currently inhibits conclusive detection of scattered light from this exoplanet. However, the amplitude of observed variability conservatively sets a 99.7% confidence upper limit to the planet-induced polarization of the system of 58 ppm in B band, which is consistent with a previous upper limit from the POLISH instrument at the Palomar Observatory 5-m telescope (Wiktorowicz 2009). A physically-motivated Rayleigh scattering model, which includes the depolarizing effects of multiple scattering, is used to conservatively set a 99.7% confidence upper limit to the geometric albedo of HD 189733b of A<sub>g</sub> < 0.36. This value is consistent with the value A<sub>g</sub> = 0.226 ± 0.091 derived from occultation observations with HST STIS (Evans et al. 2013), but it is inconsistent with the large A<sub>g</sub> = 0.61 ± 0.12 albedo reported by Berdyugina et al.

The exceptional brightness of the host star enables unique and highly precise observations of this extreme super-Earth. We have obtained continuous MOST photometry of the system every year since 2011, for a total of over 70 days of observations. In light of recent reports of variability in the transit and eclipse depths of this planet, we analyse our multi-year photometry to explore any differences in the measured transit depth from one observing season to the next. Our analysis also improves the precision on the transit parameters of 55 Cnc e and provides an updated value of the planetary radius. The MOST 2011 discovery data for this intriguing super-Earth exhibits a low-amplitude variation at the orbital period of the planet which cannot be solely explained by scattered light. We present continuing evidence of this effect in subsequent MOST photometry of 55 Cnc, and find that its amplitude and phase change between observing seasons. We also perform a global analysis of the entire MOST data set and present limits on the secondary eclipse, and hence the geometric albedo of 55 Cnc e.

We detect an average secondary eclipse for groups of super-Earth, Neptune-like, and other sub-Saturn-sized candidates by scaling and combining photometric data of the groups of candidates such that the eclipses add constructively.  This greatly increases the signal-to-noise compared to combining eclipses for individual planets.  We have modified our method for averaging short cadence light curves of multiple planet candidates (2014, ApJ, 794, 133), and have applied it to long cadence data, accounting for the broadening of the eclipse due to the 30 minute cadence.  We then use the secondary eclipse depth to determine the average albedo for the group.  In the short cadence data, we found that a group of close-in sub-Saturn candidates (1 to 6 Earth radii) was more reflective (geometric A ~ 0.22) than typical hot Jupiters (geometric A ~ 0.06 to 0.11: Demory 2014, ApJL, 789, L20).

Real-time prediction updates allowed placement of the SOFIA telescope with its four detectors deep within the central-flash region of the atmospheric occultation.

The relative orientations and asymmetries in the various central flash data allow us to use them to tightly constrain the lower atmospheric ellipticity and orientation of likely winds with respect to Pluto’s figure. The ratio of the two separate central flashes (airborne and ground-based) is also a strong constraint on the geometric solution for the full occultation data set, and the absolute height of the central flashes with respect to those expected for a clear isothermal atmosphere places constraints on haze densities and thermal gradients in Pluto’s lower atmosphere.

Zhang,Sessioned,University of Florida; Universidad de Chile,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present models of photoionization of massive protostellar cores, and show the impact of this ionization feedback on the efficiency of star formation and its observational features. Based on the Core Accretion scenario, we construct the collapse model of rotating massive-protostellar cloud cores together with a protostellar evolutional calculation, including feedback effects from a MHD disk wind, photoionization and radiation pressure. First, the MHD wind creates a bipolar outflow whose opening angle increases over the timescale of mass accretion. The ionizing luminosity dramatically increases after the protostar reaches ~ 5 Msun due to Kelvin-Helmholz contraction, and the MHD wind is photoionized when the protostellar mass reaches ~ 10 - 20 Msun. As the ionizing and bolometric luminosities increase, the outflow opening angle becomes wider due to radiation pressure feedback. By this combination of feedback processes, the envelope is eroded and the mass infall rate is significantly reduced to that arriving only from the disk-shielded equatorial region. At a protostellar mass of ~ 50 - 100 Msun, depending on the initial core properties, the mass accretion is halted by disk photoevaporation. In this way, feedback significantly reduces the star formation efficiency when forming massive stars from massive cloud cores, which could produce a cutoff at the high-mass end of the initial mass function. Along this evolutionary calculation, we also compute the detailed structure of the photoionized regions using a ray-tracing radiative transfer code and evaluate their emission signatures. Their free-free continuum and recombination line emissions are consistent with the variety of observed radio sources associated with massive protostars, i.e., jets and ultra/hyper-compact HII regions. The comparison between our models and such observations enables us to better define the evolutionary sequence of massive star formation.\n",1,

We create detailed numerical simulations of this process, utilizing the Enzo code with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), including non-ideal effects, and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to explore how cloud collisions trigger formation of dense filaments, clumps and stars. We implement photo-dissociation region (PDR) based density/temperature/extinction-dependent heating and cooling functions that span the atomic to molecular transition and can return detailed diagnostic information. We first carried out a parameter space study via a suite of 2D simulations, which track the fate of an initially stable clump embedded within one of the clouds. We have then extended these calculations to 3D, including introduction of initial turbulence into the clouds and magnetically-regulated sub-grid models for star formation. Different magnetic field strengths and orientations are considered, as is the role of cloud collisions at various velocities and impact parameters. We examine the effects of including ambipolar diffusion. Between isolated and colliding cases, the density and kinematic structure are visualized and characterized, in addition to magnetic field configuration. We discuss observational diagnostics of cloud collisions, focusing on 13CO(J=2-1), 13CO(J=3-2), and 12CO(J=8-7) integrated intensity maps and spectra, which we synthesize from our simulation outputs. We find the ratio of J=8-7 to lower-J emission to be a powerful diagnostic probe of GMC collisions. We also analyze magnetic field orientation relative to filamentary structure, comparing to observations within the Galaxy.

To investigate this possibility, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations where we vary the stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field strength. We generate synthetic 12CO(1-0) maps assuming that the simulation is at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By comparing different initial conditions and evolutionary times, we are able to identify differences in our synthetic observations. Using a variety of statistical techniques proposed in the literature, we quantify the differences by calculating the first, second, and higher order moment maps of the data cubes, analyzing the power spectrum, and convolving the data with Gaussian wavelets. We find that many turbulent statistics, such as the spectral correlation function, principal component analysis, and delta-variance, are sensitive to changes in mass-loss rates and/or turbulent structure. This demonstrates that stellar feedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and may be characterized using certain statistical metrics.\n",3,

T. Williams*,P. T. Williams*,Sessioned,unaffiliated,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Twenty-five years ago, Pringle suggested a boundary-layer origin for jets from YSOs. The jets were driven by a toroidal magnetic field generated by strong shear in the accretion boundary layer. Such a mechanism is clearly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature.<br /><br />Nearly fifteen years ago, we suggested a cartoon of the jet-launching mechanism in protostars in which shear, acting upon MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), generated a tangled, toroidal magnetic field capable of driving a jet. This picture, which is also manifestly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature, relied upon a novel model for MRI-driven MHD turbulence based on a viscoelastic, rather than a viscous, prescription for the turbulent stress. Our hypothesis has some clear similarities to Pringle's mechanism, but it relied upon a large envelope surrounding the central star.<br /><br />An accretion boundary layer has long been recognized as a promising source for protostellar jets in good part because in a standard thin disk, matter loses circa half of all its accretion energy in this layer, but it is problematic to drive a well-collimated outflow from a boundary layer in a thin disk. In this presentation, we argue paradoxically that the ""boundary layer"" can drive jets when a true boundary layer, like the thin disk, does not exist. This changes the inner boundary condition for viscous angular momentum flux in the disk.<br /><br />The standard argument for a thin boundary layer is, we argue, circular. In high accretion-rate systems, or when the gas cannot cool efficiently, there is no reason to suspect the turbulent viscosity in this boundary layer to be small, and therefore neither is the boundary layer. When the boundary layer becomes larger than the central accretor itself, it is arguably no longer a boundary layer, but rather an envelope. It is still, however, a substantial source of power and toroidal MRI-driven magnetic fields.<br /><br />It is, again, only in relatively hot or high-accretion rate systems in which the boundary layer would be expected to inflate and so disappear. Not coincidentally, it is in such systems, such as Class 0 and Class I protostars, in which we have the strongest evidence for powerful, well-collimated jet outflows.\n",4,

The formation mechanism of massive stars remains much debated, with the central question being whether it is simply a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation from gas cores or involves more complex, chaotic accretion flows in the crowded centers of concurrently forming star clusters. Using the unique ~10 to 40 micron imaging capabilities of SOFIA-FORCAST, we are in the process of observing a large (>40) sample of high- and intermediate-mass protostars in a variety of Galactic environments. These observations probe warm dust that is often a signature of irradiated protostellar outflow cavities. Thus analysis of the resulting spectral energy distributions and multi-wavelength images and comparison with radiative transfer models provides powerful constraints on the geometry of dense accretion flows and lower density outflows around these protostars, and thus tests massive star formation theories.

These galaxies serve as analogs to high-redshift (<i>z </i>> 2) Lyman break galaxies, and within the larger sample of Lyman break analogs (LBAs) are sufficiently nearby (< 87 Mpc) to be spatially-resolved by <i>Chandra</i>. Previous studies of the X-ray emission in LBAs have found that the 2-10 keV luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) in these galaxies is elevated, potentially because of their low metallicities (12+log[O/H]=8.3-8.4). Theoretically, the progenitors of XRBs forming in lower metallicity environments lose less mass from stellar winds over their lifetimes, producing more massive compact objects (i.e., neutron stars and black holes), and thus resulting in more numerous and luminous HMXBs per SFR. In this talk, I present our in-depth study of the only two LBAs that have spatially-resolved 2-10 keV emission with <i>Chandra</i> to present the bright end of the X-ray luminosity distribution of HMXBs (L<sub>X</sub>>10<sup>39</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>; ultraluminous X-ray sources, ULXs) in these low-metallicity galaxies, based on 8 detected ULXs. Comparing with the star-forming galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF), Haro 11 and VV 114 host ~4 times more L<sub>X</sub>>10<sup>40</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> sources than expected given their SFRs. We simulate the effects of source blending from crowded lower luminosity HMXBs using the star-forming galaxy XLF and then vary the XLF normalizations and bright-end slopes until we reproduce the observed point source luminosity distributions. Based on this analysis, we find that these LBAs have a shallower bright end slope than the standard XLF.\n",1,

D. Wang*,Q. D. Wang*; S. lim,Sessioned,Univ. of Massachusetts,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Stellar feedback remains a key uncertain aspect in galaxy formation and evolution theories. In addition to the mechanical energy injection from fast stellar winds and supernovae of massive stars, their radiative transfer feedback (via direct and indirect/dust-processed radiation pressures and photo-ionization) has also been proposed to play a significant role in dispersing dense dusty gas and possibly in driving outflows from starburst regions. To test the relative efficiency of these two forms of the stellar feedback, we study the energetics of the Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The nebula consists of various blisters of diffuse hot plasma enveloped by cool gas. Based on the X-ray spectroscopy of the nebula, using a 100 ks Suzaku X-ray observation, we estimate the thermal energy of the enclosed plasma, accounting for its temperature distribution and foreground absorption variation. The estimated thermal energy is far short of the expected fraction of the mechanical energy input from the central young stellar association (NGC 2070) of the nebula, according to the classic superbubble solution, indicating a substantial loss of energy via probably hot electron-dust interaction and cosmic-ray acceleration, as well as the cool shell formation. We further characterize the kinetic energy of dense dusty gas, using a recently published dust mass map and the velocity dispersion inferred from molecular and HI gases in the nebula. However, this component of the kinetic energy appears to be dominated by the turbulent and bulk motions of HII gas. The total kinetic energy of the nebula is consistent with the expected fraction of the mechanical energy input. Therefore, the radiation transfer feedback does not seem to play a significant role in the expansion of 30 Doradus.\n",5,

Like most programs, Florida Institute of Technology (Florida Tech or FIT) strongly encourages undergraduate research, but is dominated by content-focused courses (e.g., “Physical Mechanics”). Research-like experiences are generally offered through “lab” classes, but these are almost always reproductions of past experiments:  contrived, formulaic, and lacking the “heart” of real (i.e., potentially publishable) scientific research.<br /> <br />Real research opportunities 1) provide students with realistic insight into the actual scientific process; 2) excite students far more than end-of-chapter problems; 3) provide context for the importance of learning math, physics, and astrophysics concepts; and 4) allow unique research progress for well-chosen problems. I have provided real research opportunities as an “Exoplanet Lab” component of my Introduction to Space Science (SPS1020) class at Florida Tech, generally taken by first-year majors in our Physics, Astronomy & Astrophysics, Planetary Science, and Astrobiology degree programs. These labs are a hybrid between citizen science (e.g., PlanetHunters) and simultaneously mentoring ~60 undergraduates in similar small research projects. These projects focus on problems that can be understood in the context of the course, but which benefit from “crowdsourcing”. Examples include: dividing up the known planetary systems and developing a classification scheme and organizing them into populations (Fall 2013); searching through folded light curves to discover new exoplanets missed by previous pipelines (Fall 2014); and fitting n-body models to all exoplanets with known Transit Timing Variations to estimate planet masses (Fall 2015). The students love the fact that they are doing real potentially publishable research: not many undergraduates can claim to have discovered new exoplanets!<br /> <br />Based on these experiences, I will present practical insights into successfully organizing real research opportunities. By employing some of these best practices, we can truly educate students and make scientific progress.\n",1,

Athabasca University has been offering distance education astronomy courses using computer simulations of the night sky for nearly three decades. A recurring theme has been the challenge of matching available software to the computers available to students in their homes. Stellarium is useful in this respect in being available as downloadable freeware for Windows, Mac, and linux, and available from third parties for other platforms. Stellarium is useful for giving a qualitative idea of sky movements that take place slowly in nature. A night, or even a year, can be presented in sped up time, or with large time steps allowing to see changes. Our Science-stream freshman course emphasizes quantitative analysis, and Stellarium is also useful for this. Plotting the Sun’s position at noon (allowing for Daylight Savings Time) gives an analemma from which the obliquity can be readily calculated. The Moon’s daily motion can be measured in degrees with local declination lines as a reference, allowing the eccentricity of its orbit to be demonstrated. Plotting retrograde loops for outer planets corrects the misimpression students sometimes develop that this is a phenomenon restricted to Mars. For both inner and outer planets, the relation of synodic and sidereal periods may be explored quantitatively. Most recently we are exploring the possibility of replacing our HR diagram and Hubble Law plots with data gathered from Stellarium. Data in these is not directly measured as are the variables in planetary motion labs, but an observational feel can be added to labs that otherwise (if done using published tables of data) could seem divorced from observation. Stellarium can help attain a large number of objectives in introductory astronomy education, from truly understanding basic phenomena to making and interpreting quantitative measurements.\n",8,

Van Der Marel,Sessioned,STScI; Johns Hopkins University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Milky Way (MW) mass is a fundamental quantity for understanding the MW in a cosmological context. The mass distribution of the MW halo has been traditionally determined by measuring the motions of tracer objects such as halo stars, globular clusters (GCs), and satellite galaxies. Despite various efforts, the MW mass at large Galactocentric radius (R_GC > 10 kpc) is poorly known mainly due to the uncertainties in the velocity anisotropy of tracer objects. To remedy this, proper motion (PM) measurements of halo tracers are highly desired. In this talk, I will introduce our HST projects for measuring proper motions of MW satellite objects. I will discuss progress, preliminary results, and implications.\n",1,

Most potential recovery methods rely on full, observationally expensive, 6D information for the stream member stars. Consequently, current constraints of the Milky Way potential are based on individual streams, with some tension between different streams.<br /><br />These discrepancies can be resolved by simultaneously modeling multiple stellar streams that have been discovered in the Galactic halo. We use two most prominent cold streams in the Milky Way, tidal tails of the Palomar 5 globular cluster and GD-1 stream, to measure the global properties of our dark matter halo. Based on the analysis of synthetic streams on similar orbits in a realistic dark matter-only simulation, we discuss which new data would most improve our understanding of the Galactic gravitational potential.\n",2,

Its structure and kinematics provide a unique archaeological record of the MW's formation, past evolution, and accretion history. These data also help us constrain the dark matter mass out to large radii (50 to 100 kpc). However, studies of the MW stellar halo are hindered by observational constraints. Beyond D~10 kpc, our knowledge of the MW halo is limited to line of sight velocities and rare tracer populations (blue horizontal branch and red giant branch stars). We aim to address these limitations using highly accurate HST-measured proper motions and very deep (8-24 hour integrations) Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy of MW main sequence turn-off stars in the CANDELS fields. By combining these two datasets, we can obtain 6D phase-space information plus chemical abundances (7 ""Dimensions"") for our halo stars. This survey, which will be unique even in the era of Gaia, will vastly improve our understanding of the Milky Way structure, evolution and mass in a way that neither the HST proper motions nor Keck spectroscopy can do on their own.\n",3,

Hogg,Sessioned,Columbia University; University of Michigan; New York University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Cosmological simulations predict that dark matter halos around galaxies should be triaxial in shape with universal density profiles. A significant number of orbits in such systems are  chaotic, though it is commonly assumed that chaos is not dynamically relevant for galaxy halos because the timescales over which chaos is computed to be important are generally long relative to the dynamical time. In recent work, we showed that even when chaos is not important for restructuring the global structure of a galaxy, chaos can greatly enhance the density evolution and alter the morphologies of stellar streams over just a few orbital times by causing streams to 'fan out.' This occurs because the orbits of the stars in stellar streams have small distributions of fundamental frequencies and are therefore sensitive to mild chaos that modulates the frequencies on small-scales over much faster timescales. This suggests that the morphology of tidal streams alone can be used to estimate the significance of chaos along the orbits of the progenitor systems, thereby placing constraints on the global properties of the gravitational potential. I will explain our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon and discuss implications for a recently discovered stellar stream (the Ophiuchus stream) that may be on a chaotic orbit in the inner Milky Way due to the influence of the time-dependent, triaxial potential of the Galactic bar.\n",4,

This technique uses correlations in velocity-distance phase space, accounting for the LAMOST selection function, to statistically identify stellar excesses relative to a smooth underlying model of Galactic populations. We show that the stellar halo between 20-40 kpc from the Galactic center has a level of substructure similar to model halos built purely from accreted satellites. The detected SHARDS have velocity and metallicity dispersions similar to those predicted by accretion-dominated mock halos.

This model has many seemingly strange aspects: an inflationary period, during which quantum mechanical fluctuations set the initial conditions for the formation of galaxies and clusters; dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the Universe, and yet have no established relation to the more familiar visible particles and fields; and -- if dark energy is a cosmological constant -- a future in which the Universe enters a permanent exponential expansion phase, with a limiting finite ""temperature"" and observable volume. Over the past 15 years, a diverse array of observations have continued to support the simplest version of this model at ever-improving levels of precision (although not without a few anomalies). I will describe this development from the perspective of one participant, with an emphasis on a subset of the observational probes -- the cosmic microwave background, galaxy surveys, and gravitational lensing. I will emphasize in particular the demands of tight control of systematic errors in both the observations and the theoretical predictions, and the impact this has had on the organization of research programs in cosmology.<br /><br />I will then turn to the the future of statistical cosmology. In the near term, a major goal in dark energy is to use new facilities to go beyond fitting a small number of parameters, and map out the full history of the expansion of the Universe and the growth of structures. I will describe some of these ambitious efforts to probe the effects of dark energy in the distant past, when it was a subdominant component of the cosmic energy budget.

The existence of high energy gamma rays implies that even higher energy particles are being accelerated placing strong constraints on these non-thermal accelerators. Within our galaxy, TeV gamma rays have been detected from supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebula, x-ray binaries and some yet to be identified sources in the Galactic plane. In addition, these gamma rays have sufficient energy to be attenuated by the interaction with infrared photons producing an electron-positron pair. Thus the spectrum of gamma rays can also constrain the infrared photon density, which for distant extragalactic sources is a direct probe of cosmology. The known extragalactic TeV sources are primarily the blazer class of active galactic nuclei. And TeV gamma rays might even be produced by annihilating dark matter.<br /><br />The US currently supports two ground-based gamma-ray observatories—HAWC and VERITAS—and NSF is developing a prototype for the international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.

Y. Kim*,S. Y. Kim*; A. Peter,Sessioned,The Ohio State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): While the ΛCDM model has been wildly successful at explaining structure on large scales, it fails to do so on small scales---dark matter halos of scales comparable to that of galaxy clusters and smaller are more cored and less numerous than ΛCDM predicts. One potential solution challenges the canonical assumption that dark matter is collisionless and instead assumes that it is collisional, or self-interacting. The most stringent upper limits on the dark matter self-interaction cross section have come from observations of merging galaxy clusters. Self-interactions cause the merging dark matter halos to evolve differently from the galaxies, which are effectively collisionless. It has been hypothesized that this leads to an spatial offset between the peaks in the dark matter and galaxy distributions. We show that in equal mass mergers offsets do not develop except under a narrow range of merger conditions. Mergers with observable offsets have an infall velocity comparable to the escape velocity from a halo---promoting the explusion of significant mass and the formation of tails---and is head-on. We discuss other observable signatures of self-interactions that may better constrain the dark matter self-interaction cross-section in equal mass cluster mergers.\n",3,

Brooks*,A. Brooks*; J. Sloane; M. Buckley,Sessioned,Rutgers University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Experiments that will directly detect dark matter are strongly dependent on the velocity of the dark matter particle. These experiments are composed of various elements; the heavier the element, the higher the velocity of dark matter must be to register a visible impact. The velocity of the dark matter is set by astrophysics. To date, all direct detection experiments assume that the dark matter in the Milky Way follows a Maxwellian velocity distribution. N-Body simulations that include only dark matter have long shown that this assumption is incorrect. In this work, we use high resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stellar physics, in order to explore the additional effect of baryons on the velocity distribution of dark matter in the solar neighborhood. We show that the baryons have a significant impact, altering the predictions from the dark matter-only case, leading to a distribution that is closer to Maxwellian. However, in all of our galaxies, the high velocity tail drops off more steeply than in the standard Maxwellian. We discuss how the inclusion of baryons change the interpretation of current direct detection experiments.\n",7,

Daylan*,T. Daylan*; S. Portillo; D. P. Finkbeiner,Sessioned,Harvard University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Poisson regression of the Fermi-LAT data in the inner Milky Way reveals an extended gamma-ray excess. The anomalous emission falls steeply away from the galactic center and has an energy spectrum that peaks at 1-2 GeV. An important question is whether the signal is coming from a collection of unresolved point sources, possibly recycled pulsars, or constitutes a truly diffuse emission component. Previous analyses have relied on non-Poissonian template fits or wavelet decomposition of the Fermi-LAT data, which find evidence for a population of dim point sources just below the 3FGL flux limit. In order to be able to make conclusions about such a dim population we propose to sample from the catalogue space of point sources in the inner galaxy, where the model dimensionality, i.e., the number of sources, is unknown. Although being a computationally expensive sampling problem, this approach allows us to infer the number, luminosity and radial distribution of the point source population that is consistent with the data while providing a Bayesian evidence for the point source hypothesis, which is independent of the model indicator. This talk will focus on the method of trans-dimensional sampling using the reversible-jump formalism and its application to the inference of a mock point source population.

Motivated by the point source interpretation, we implement a Bayesian method for producing probabilistic catalogues to constrain the population of point sources below the Fermi LAT detection limit. To validate our method, we apply it to the high latitude Fermi LAT data to confirm that the probabilistic catalogue recovers the resolved sources in the Fermi Collaboration’s 3FGL catalogue. Then, we compare our constraints on the unresolved point source population at high latitude to those obtained using non-Poissonian template fitting.\n",9,

As the two stars pass through periastron, the tidal distortion causes unique brightness variations.  Short period, eccentric binary stars, like these, are theorized to pseudosynchronize, or reach a rotational frequency that matches the weighted average orbital angular velocity of the system.  This pseudosynchronous rate, as predicted by Hut (1981), depends on the binary's orbital period and eccentricity.  We tested whether sixteen heartbeat stars have pseudosynchronized. We measure the rotation rate from obvious spot signatures in the light curve.  We measure the eccentricity by fitting the light curve using PHOEBE and are actively carrying out a radial velocity monitoring program with Keck/HIRES in order to improve these orbital parameters.  Our initial results show that while most heartbeat stars appear to have pseudosynchronized we find stars with rotation frequencies both longer and shorter than this rate.

Current 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution these systems following the mass transfer, binary orbital parameters, and the self-consistent gravitational field over several tens of orbital periods have produced a wealth of data. However, these simulations can take weeks to months in high-performance computing platforms to execute. To help with the interpretation of results of such large scale simulations, and to enable a quick exploration of binary parameter space, we have developed a Mathematica code that integrates forward in time a system of 5 ODEs describing the orbit-averaged evolution of the binary separation as well as the radius, mass, and spin angular momentum of both components of the binary. By adjusting a few parameters describing the mass transfer as a function of the Roche-lobe overflow and the strength of the tidal coupling between the orbit and component spins we are able to obtain approximate fits to previously run hydrodynamic simulations. This simplified simulation is able to run simulations similar to the hydrodynamic versions in a matter of seconds on a dual-core PC or Mac computer.\n",11,

We observe an X-ray energy dependence on the orbital phase, consistent with the black hole moving through the dense stellar wind of the donor star.

An issue in the theory of these low-mass stars is the discrepancy between their predicted and observed radii.

Modeling the light curves of eclipsing binary stars with M-type companions is how their radii and other fundamental parameters can be determined.

Our monitoring resulted in a large, homogeneous data set with an unprecedented time-sampling, spectral resolving power, and signal-to-noise. We investigated temporal variability previously unexplored in the system and found a kinematic structure in the P Cygni absorption troughs of neutral helium (He I) wind lines. The features observed occurred prior to periastron passage and are seen as we look through the trailing arm of the wind-wind collision zone. We show that the bulk of the variability is repeatable across the last five periastron passages, and that the absorption likely occurs in the inner 230 AU of the system. In addition, we found a secondary, high-velocity (-800 km/s) absorption component superimposed on the P Cygni absorption troughs that has been previously unobserved in these lines, but which bears resemblance to the observations of the He I λ10830Å feature observed across previous cycles. Through a comparison with smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we show that the observed variations are likely caused by instabilities in the wind-wind collision region in our line of sight, coupled with stochastic variability related to clumping in the winds. We speculate that the stochastic high-velocity absortion feature we observed before periastron was caused by a small 'blob' of dense material breaking free from the unstable WWC region and crossing our line of sight as it was accelerated by the much faster (3000 km/s) impinging wind from the hotter secondary star.\n",20,

Despite preventing us from the direct view from the central source, the Homunculus acts like a mirror, allowing us to see the spectrum of the central binary system from different stellar latitudes. Therefore, by mapping the spectrum along the nebula we are actually probing the dependence of the spectrum with stellar latitude. Our project focuses on the P Cyg absorption component of H lines mostly in the optical and near-infrared wavelengths. in order to investigate the structure of the primary stellar wind. A full spectral mapping of the entire nebula was constructed by combining multiple dithered long slit observations using the ESO/X-Shooter high-resolution spectrograph. Such mapping allowed us to assemble a data cube containing the spectrum of each position along the nebula. Preliminary analysis confirms that the primary wind indeed has a deeper absorption component at high stellar latitudes (polar region). Also, contrary to our expectations, our analysis indicates that the polar region does not seem entirely radially symmetric in terms of density, which invites further investigation into the source of these discrepancies.\n",21,

The current model known as ΛCDM explains that galaxies form and evolve in halos composed of cold dark matter. In an effort to understand galactic processes in relation to halos, researchers have developed statistical methods to connect galaxies to their halos. One of these approaches is abundance matching: a technique in which the galaxy number density of a property is connected to a theoretical halo number density. In this study, we exploit the abundance matching technique and create a massive photometric mock catalog. We populate millions of dark matter halos in the Bolshoi-Planck Simulation with highly defined galaxies that each has: luminosities, magnitudes, fluxes, masses, and Sérsic profiles. Our catalog acts as an interface between cold dark matter theory and observations: astronomers can use this mock galaxy catalog to compare ΛCDM predictions to observations as well as constrain galaxy formation models. Using our catalog, we can make powerful predictions about both theoretical data and about future astronomical surveys. We demonstrate the usability of our catalog through angular power spectra. Specifically, we shed light on the controversial intrahalo light phenomena.

The Committee on the Participation of Women in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (CPWS) was formed to evaluate the climate and demographics within the SDSS collaboration and to make recommendations for how best to establish the scientific and technical leadership team for SDSS-IV. Building on the work described in Lundgren et al. (2015), the CPWS conducted a demographic survey in Spring 2015 that included questions about career and leadership status, racial / ethnic identity, gender identity, identification with the LGBT community, disability, partnership status, and level of parental education. For example, 71% of survey respondents identify as male and 81% do not identify as a racial or ethnic minority at their current institution. This reflects the under-representation of women and men from minority groups (e.g., people of color in the United States) and women from majority groups (e.g., white women in the United States) in the field of astronomy. We have focused our analysis on the representation of scientists from these groups among the SDSS-IV leadership and the full collaboration. Our goal is to use these quantitative data to track the demographics of SDSS-IV membership and leadership over time as we work to assess and improve the climate of SDSS-IV.\n",3,

In order to verify meeting photometric calibration requirements, we are obtaining imaging of several hundred white dwarfs (confirmed and candidates) to select nearly 100 or more hydrogen atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs for spectroscopy in the DES footprint. The spectra that are obtained will be extracted and used to derive synthetic spectra that can be compared with DES measurements from imaging in each of the DES grizY filters. This comparison should be able to verify and help calibrate the survey to a level better than 2% photometrically and to better than 0.5% in colors.  We will discuss the observational and modeling effort required to develop a well-characterized DAs sample and present some preliminary results. This set would form the basis of a larger set of southern hemisphere survey calibration stars, and additionally serve as a legacy calibration set in the upcoming era of the LSST survey and the giant segmented mirror observatories.  These stars will be used to establish and monitor the color zero points for the DES photometric system and can be used to search for systematic errors in the color zero points over the DES footprint.  These stars will also be used as some of the primary standards for the DES photometric system which will allow nightly atmospheric monitoring during DES operations.<br />\n",4,

SpIES was designed to probe enough volume to perform measurements of the z>3 quasar clustering and luminosity function in order to test various “AGN feedback’’ models. Additionally, the wide range of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch ancillary data makes SpIES a prime location to identify both high-redshift (z>6) quasars as well as obscured quasars missed by optical surveys. SpIES maps ~115deg<sup>2</sup> of Stripe 82 to depths of 6.3 uJy (21.9 AB Magnitudes) and 5.75 uJy (22.0 AB Magnitudes) at [3.6] and [4.5] microns respectively; depths significantly greater than WISE. Here we define the SpIES survey parameters and describe the image processing, source extraction, and catalog production methods used to analyze the SpIES data. Amongst our preliminary science results, we show high significance detections of spectroscopically confirmed, z~5 quasars in the SpIES data. This work is based [in part] on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.

To encourage this, the Fermi guest investigator (GI) program supports a variety of scientific inquiries that benefit overall Fermi science. The GI program also provides access to radio, optical, X-ray and VHE gamma-ray data and/or observing time, encouraging and enabling relevant multi-wavelength studies. This approach has allowed for new analyses and ideas to flourish, leading to world-class groundbreaking science and a number of unexpected discoveries. The program has also supported a number of multi-year, multi-wavelength observing programs resulting in a rich variety of publicly available resources. Here we describe the most significant results from the Fermi GI program, including those resulting from both sky-survey and target of opportunity pointed observations. We discuss the public resources the program has supported, both for broad-band data acquisition and for the development of new analysis methods and techniques. Additionally, we consider the ramifications of the existence of long-term multi-wavelength datasets, such as those enabled by the Fermi GI program, for future scientific inquiry.\n",6,

Resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen should obscure such galaxies if the intergalactic medium is neutral, implying a steep decline in their observed counts at redshifts prior to the central phases of reionization. We are pursuing a pair of ambitious near-infrared narrow bandpass surveys to probe these populations: The Cosmic Deep and Wide Narrowband (DAWN) survey, using the NEWFIRM camera at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory's 4m Mayall telescope, and the First Light And Reionization Experiment (FLARE), using the FourStar camera at the 6.5m Magellan Telescopes. DAWN is an NOAO survey program, covering a total of five NEWFIRM fields (one square degree in all) to a limiting sensitivity around 9e-18 erg/cm2/s for emission lines at 1.06 micron wavelength, corresponding to redshift 7.7 for Lyman alpha. FLARE uses the larger aperture of the Magellan telescope to push to still higher redshift, with a limiting line flux near 5e-18 erg/cm2/s in the COSMOS field, and with additional coverage of a half dozen strongly lensed fields where we can probe still further down the Lyman alpha luminosity function. Imaging observations are largely complete for both surveys, and we are now pursuing spectroscopic followup at both near-IR and optical wavelengths. We will summarize initial results from both surveys in this meeting. With two nights of Keck+MOSFIRE observations complete already (and more scheduled in late 2015), we have numerous emission line confirmations-- both including many H alpha and Oxygen emitters in the foreground, and at least one Lyman alpha galaxy in the epoch of reionization.\n",7,

Prince,Sessioned,JPL; Caltech; UC Berkeley,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) is a dedicated time-domain survey optimized for the rapid characterization of fast transients. While significant efforts have been devoted to the development of software that quickly and reliably identifies new transients, there are currently no mechanisms to automatically classify these sources. The first component in deriving a classification is understanding whether or not the newly discovered transient is galactic or extragalactic in its origin. Here, we present our development of a new framework for classifying sources in iPTF reference images as either stars or galaxies. The framework utilizes the random forest algorithm and is trained with nearly 3 million sources that have Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. The final optimized model achieves a cross-validation accuracy of ~96%, which represents a significant improvement over the automated classification provided by the SExtractor algorithm. This accuracy, while slightly worse than that provided by the SDSS photometric classifier, can be extended over the entire iPTF footprint, which covers >5000 deg^2 that have not been imaged by SDSS. Associating transients with galactic or extragalactic origin is the first step in delivering automated classifications of newly discovered transients.\n",11,

It uses data streams generated by the Catalina Sky Survey, which searches for near-Earth asteroids, to search for variable objects and transient events. The CRTS survey has been in operation since 2008, with the archival data going back to 2005.  The survey covers the total area of ~33,000 deg2, down to ~19-21 mag per exposure, with time baselines from 10 min to ~10 years, and growing; there are now typically ~ 200-400 exposures per pointing, and coadded images reach deeper than ~ 23 mag. The area coverage rate will increase substantially as new cameras are being deployed, and possible new data streams opened. The survey has so far detected nearly 11,000 unique, high-amplitude transients, including ~3,000 confirmed or likely supernovae (for the 5 years in a row we published more supernovae than any other survey), at least 1,500 CVs (the great majority of them previously uncatalogued), >3,000 of blazars and other AGN, and a broad variety of other types of objects.<br /><br />CRTS is intended to be a data resource for the entire astronomical community.  We have a completely open data policy: all discovered transient events are published in real time with no proprietary delay period, and all data are made public, in order to better serve the entire community, and maximize the scientific returns.  This includes an archive of ~500 million light curves, which are being updated continuously. This is an unprecedented data set for the exploration of the time domain, in terms of the area, depth, and temporal coverage.<br /><br />Numerous scientific projects have been enabled by this data stream, including: discoveries of ultraluminous and otherwise peculiar SNe; unusual CVs and dwarf novae; mapping of the structure in the Galactic halo using RR Lyrae; variability-based discovery of AGN and probes of their physics; etc. We also have a major effort on the automated classification of transient and variable sources.

Barnes,Sessioned,Brigham Young University; Salt Lake Community College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Photometric redshifts are routinely obtained for galaxies without emission using broadband photometry. It is possible in theory to derive reasonably accurate (< 200 km/sec) photometric redshift values for emission-line objects using “ramp” filters with a linearly increasing/decreasing transmission through the bandpass. To test this idea we have obtained a set of filters tuned for isolating H-alpha at a redshift range of 0-10,000 km/sec. These filters consist of two that vary close to linearly in transmission, have opposite slope, and cover the wavelength range from 655nm – 685nm, plus a Stromgren y and 697nm filter to measure the continuum. Redshifts are derived from the ratio of the ramp filters indices after the continuum has been subtracted out. We are finishing the process of obtaining photometric data on a set of about 100 galaxies with known redshift to calibrate the technique and will report on our results.\n",15,

Photometrically, the source had a visual magnitude of V = 17.3 between 2002 and 2008. Then, over the following 5 years, the source slowly brightened by approximately one magnitude, to V = 16.2.  A combination of archival and newly acquired spectra reveal the source to be an iron low-ionization broad absorption line (Fe-LoBAL) quasar with extreme changes in its absorption spectrum. Some absorption features completely disappear over the 9 years of optical spectra, while other features remain essentially unchanged.  Absorption systems separated by several 1000 km/s in velocity show coordinated changes in the depths of their troughs, correlated with the flux changes. Therefore, we interpret the variability in the absorption troughs to be due to changes in photoionization, rather than due to motion of material into our line of sight.  This source highlights the sort of rare transition objects that astronomy will now be finding through dedicated time domain surveys.<br />\n",16,

NGC 7798 was not detected, but NGC 7817 and the other galaxies were cross-identified in NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database as well as in Sloan Digital Sky Survey to obtain optical data. Out of the ten, two of the sources were uncatalogued. We analyzed the hydrogen spectra and aperture photometry to learn about the characteristics of these galaxies such as their heliocentric velocity, flux, and mass of the neutral hydrogen.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), we are conducting a multi-configuration continuum imaging survey to enrich the legacy of the Frontier Fields by providing unique measurements derived from deep 3 and 6 GHz images. While the deep HST and Spitzer/IRAC data provide unprecedented constraints on stellar populations, stellar masses, and galaxy morphologies, they are only sensitive to unobscured star-formation activity. Our radio images each have a depth of ~1 uJy and reach a resolution of 0.3 arcsec (similar to WFC3) at 6 GHz. Consequently, these new radio data provide unobscured, integrated star formation rates for highly magnified systems out to <i>z</i>~8; radio morphologies of L* galaxies out to <i>z</i>~3; sub-kpc resolution for highly magnified sources at <i>z </i>> 1; and AGN diagnostics via polarization maps and radio spectral indices. Together with the HST and Spitzer data, these new radio images will inform a variety of extragalactic topics, including the importance of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift; the evolution of supermassive black holes; the nature of starburst galaxies out to <i>z</i>~3; and the rapid evolution of galaxies in the lensing clusters themselves. To ensure that the legacy of this combined data set is realized, we will publicly distribute radio images, radio source catalogs, band-merged catalogs, a morphological analysis of the multi-wavelength HST images for all radio sources, and multi-band cutouts centered on the radio detections. Here we present initial results from our program.\n",20,

De Furio*,M. De Furio*; E. A. Lada; N. Marinas,Sessioned,University of Florida,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the current paradigm of star formation, all stars form with circumstellar disks. However, recent studies of the young NGC 2264 clusters (age ~ 2Myr, Marinas et al 2013; 2015) have unexpectedly revealed that stars with masses less than 0.3 solar masses exhibit a lower circumstellar disk fraction than more massive stars in the clusters. Is it possible that a significant number of very low mass stars form without a disk? To answer this, we are studying three very young embedded clusters (age<1Myr) in the Orion B Molecular Cloud. For these clusters, we are determining the disk fraction as a function of spectral type and inferred mass. Since the clusters are very young, the disk fractions should represent the initial frequency distribution of disks in these clusters. We are using FLAMINGOS NIR spectroscopy (Levine PhD UF 2006) and photometry to estimate the masses of the stars and FLAMINGOS JHK and Spitzer photometry to estimate the disk frequency of our spectroscopic sample. Our work should provide valuable insights toward understanding the formation and early evolution of circumstellar disks around low mass stars in embedded clusters.\n",1,

While spectroscopic variability in the optical range has been studied previously, the near infrared region has not been investigated as thoroughly. We present multiple epochs of near infrared spectroscopy for a sample of eight Classical Be stars. Our observations were taken using the FSPEC instrument on the 90-inch Bok reflector telescope at Kitt Peak during the months of May and June of 2010 and 2011. We targeted the Brackett Gamma emission line of hydrogen with a resolution of ≈3500. Using Python we developed tools to analyze the reduced and calibrated spectra, as well as compute equivalent widths. Time-series spectra indicate that a majority of the systems exhibit spectroscopic variability. By monitoring the strengths of the emission feature over time we aim to constrain the physical properties of these systems.\n",3,

Matthews,Sessioned,University of Toledo; East Tennessee State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gamma Cassiopeiae is a rapidly rotating Be star that has a circumstellar disk. In addition there is evidence that Gamma Cas has a binary companion which may influence its disk. In this work, we search for evidence that the binary companion truncates the disk. To do so, we construct the full spectral energy distribution (SED) of Gamma Cas using radio data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 0.6, 1.3, 3.5, and 6 cm, along with multi-wavelength archival data. The archival data include UV, optical, and IR flux calibrated spectra, optical UBVRI photometry, IR photometry, and millimeter to centimeter radio flux measurements. To model this SED, we employ the 3-D NLTE Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HDUST to calculate the emergent continuum flux for a rapidly rotating (oblate), gravity darkened Be star with a steady state viscous decretion disk. The stellar parameters are constrained using the UV portion of the spectrum. The disk inclination is determined from CHARA K-band interferometry, while the IR data determine the disk mass-loss rate. Finally, since the radio flux is determined by the disk density at large radii, the possibility of disk truncation is best probed by long wavelength data. We find that the steady state HDUST model overestimates the flux in the millimeter and submillimeter range by a factor of 5, suggesting that the disk is truncated.\n",4,

The most dramatic episodic accretion events known in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are FU Ori and EXor outbursts. FU Ori objects are characterized by a sudden brightening of 5 magnitudes or more within one year and remain bright for decades. EXor objects have lower amplitude outbursts on shorter timescales (months to years). Here we present an ALMA 230 GHz (1.3 mm / band-6) mini-survey of 8 outbursting sources (three FU Ori and ve EXor objects) in Orion with 1"" (450 AU) resolution. We present continuum, 12CO, 13CO, and C18O line images and derive dust and (when possible) gas disk masses. The disk masses derived from the line observations are systematically lower (by factors of 3-5) than those calculated from the continuum and adopting the standard gas-to-dust ratio of 100, which agrees with results on T Tauri disks in Taurus. After beam deconvolution, we nd that the disks are remarkably compact (r = 70-150 AU). The 1.3 mm fuxes of the outbursting sources span over three orders of magnitude, but the FU Ori objects are signi cantly brighter than the EXor objects. The inferred disk masses for the brightest objects are > 0.1 M<sub>solar </sub>, rendering gravitational instability a likely outburst mechanism. On the other hand, the inferred disk masses for the faintest targets are ~ 1-5 M<sub>JUP</sub> , and thus an alternative mechanism must be responsible for their outbursts.\n",5,

The reported simulations were performed employing CHYMERA, a radiative 3D hydrodynamics code developed by the Indiana University Hydrodynamics Group. The simulations include disk self-gravity and radiative cooling governed by realistic dust opacities. We examine the role of GIs in modulating the thermodynamic state of the disks, and determine the strengths of GI-induced density waves, non-axisymmetric density structures, radial mass transport, and gravitational torques. The principal goal of this study is to determine how the presence of the companion affects the nature and strength of GIs. Results are compared with a parallel simulation of a protoplanetary disk without the presence of the brown dwarf binary companion. We detect no fragmentation in either disk. A persistent vortex forms in the inner region of both disks. The vortex seems to be stabilized by the presence of the binary companion.\n",6,

Pegues*,Sessioned,Princeton University; Banneker Institute,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Nitrogen is an important component in many of the world's known organic and inorganic compounds, and its presence is crucial for the existence and survival of life as we know it on Earth today. And yet, in comparison to the total amount of nitrogen available, nitrogen exists as a depleted resource throughout the Solar System, with Earth and unearthed meteorites featuring nitrogen levels depleted from 1 to 5 orders of magnitude relative to the Sun. Additionally, comets have been discovered that contain depleted levels of N<sub>2</sub> in comparison to CO, despite the similar binding strengths of both N<sub>2</sub> and CO to ices, with ices functioning as the main component in comets.<br />Mechanisms that are likely to play a major part in the distribution of nitrogen throughout the Solar System, and other extra-solar systems, are condensation fronts, such as snowlines and snowsurfaces. Here, condensation fronts refer to the locations at which 50% of a given volatile is contained in gaseous form, while the other 50% is contained within grain form. During formation, astronomical bodies will accumulate different chemical compositions, depending upon where they form with respect to the locations of the condensation fronts within the system. In addition, a system's initial chemistry, as well as how that chemistry evolves, will ultimately alter how the volatiles in the system are distributed over time.<br />Thus, the locations of these condensation fronts, coupled with a protoplanetary disk's initial chemistry and chemical evolution, are mechanisms that affect the eventual distribution and evolution of the disk's volatiles. In this project, we characterize and interpret these mechanisms within disk models. We vary the disk's time dependence and initial chemical conditions, and then analyze the effects of those variations upon the main carriers of nitrogen in both gaseous and grain form. From observed patterns and characteristics of these varied models, we evolve our understanding of curious nitrogen depletions found within the Solar System, of the acquisition of nitrogen by astronomical bodies of the Solar System and other extra-solar systems, and of the chemistry and distribution of nitrogen during planet formation overall.\n",12,

At higher latitudes, slight changes in refraction may cause significant discrepancies, including determining even whether the Sun appears to rise or set. While different components of refraction are known, how they affect predictions of sunrise/set has not yet been quantified. A better understanding of the contributions from temperature profile, pressure, humidity, and aerosols, could significantly improve the standard prediction. Because sunrise/set times and meteorological data from multiple locations will be necessary for a thorough investigation of the problem, we will collect this data using smartphones as part of a citizen science project. This analysis will lead to more complete models that will provide more accurate times for navigators and outdoorsman alike.\n",4,

Firefly is a toolkit for the construction of Web-based applications for visualizing astronomical images and tabular data, with the software distribution also including a basic general-purpose pre-built application. The Firefly tools are the base for NASA's IRSA archive as well as other web applications developed at IPAC.<br /><br />Recent releases include new public APIs allowing the extension of Firefly functionality in various ways. New Javascript APIs allow customization of the interface presented in the browser, including the ability to define buttons for custom actions that can be performed on points, lines, and regions in images. New Python APIs allow the invocation of operations in a Firefly-based application, allowing it to serve as a display engine for FITS images and other astronomical data. In addition, the Firefly web server side has been enhanced with the ability to invoke user-supplied processes that can produce either image or tabular results based on operations on data from the application or external sources. For instance, the user can define an operation to perform source detection on a graphically selected region in an image and return the results for display as a table and/or x-y plot. User processes can be defined in any language supported on the server host; our current efforts have focused on Python. This mechanism has been used to support the integration of Firefly with the LSST project's software stack, with reusable ""tasks"" from the LSST stack configurable as extensions to Firefly.\n",6,

In particular, data are now held on-line (in a cache) removing the need to reprocess the data every time they are requested from the Archive. OTFR (on the fly reprocessing) has been replaced by a reprocessing system, which runs in the background. Data in the cache are automatically placed in the reprocessing queue when updated calibration reference files are received or when an improved calibration algorithm is installed. Data in the on-line cache are expected to be the most up to date version. These changes were phased in throughout 2015 for all active instruments.<br /><br />The on-line cache was populated instrument by instrument over the course of 2015. As data were placed in the cache, the flag that triggers OTFR was reset so that OTFR no longer runs on these data. “Hybrid” requests to the Archive are handled transparently, with data not yet in the cache provided via OTFR and the remaining data provided from the cache. Users do not need to make separate requests.<br /><br />Users of the MAST Portal will be able to download data from the cache immediately. For data not in the cache, the Portal will send the user to the standard “Retrieval Options Page,” allowing the user to direct the Archive to process and deliver the data.<br /><br />The classic MAST Search and Retrieval interface has the same look and feel as previously.

Gal-Yam*,A. Gal-Yam*; B. Zackay; E. O. Ofek,Sessioned,Weizmann Institute of Science,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Transient detection and flux measurement via image subtraction are fundamental to time domain astronomy. Starting from first principles, we develop the optimal linear statistic for transient detection and flux measurement and any other image-difference hypothesis testing. We derive a simple closed-form statistic that: (1) Is mathematically proven to be the optimal subtraction statistic in the limit of background-dominated noise within the family of linear solutions, that contains all previously suggested methods; (2) Does not leave subtraction or deconvolution artifacts, even in the vicinity of bright stars; (3) Is an order of magnitude faster to compute than popular methods; (4) Allows<br />automatic transient detection down to the theoretical sensitivity limit by providing a reliable, well-defined detection significance; (5) Is symmetric to the interchange of the new and reference images; (6) Is numerically stable; and (7) Is trivial to implement. We demonstrate<br />that the correct way to prepare a reference image is the proper image co-addition presented in Zackay & Ofek 2015. Finally, we show a proper image subtraction statistic, that, along with its point spread functions, is a sufficient statistic for any decision or measurement on the difference image. This allows accurate filtration of image artifacts such as cosmic rays and hot pixels. We demonstrate this method on simulated data as well as on observations from the Palomar Transient Factory.\n",11,

Ofek*,E. Ofek*; B. Zackay; A. Gal-Yam,Sessioned,Weizmann Institute of Science,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present image coaddition methods for source detection and flux measurement under  both the background- and source-dominated noise regimes, that are optimized to achieve the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We also derive a coaddition method, which provides a sufficient statistic for any further signal processing of the data, such as source detection, star/galaxy separation or shape measurements, in the background-noise dominated case. This means that any hypothesis testing or measurement that can be done on all the individual images simultaneously, can be equivalently performed on the coadded image without any loss of information, leading to significant reduction in data storage and transmission requirements. In addition, our method produces an image with a PSF which is typically narrower than that of the highest quality image in the original ensemble, and its noise is Gaussian white noise. For seeing-limited surveys, we argue that<br />by using these methods an increase of between a few percents to 20% in survey speed is possible relative to simple weighted coaddition techniques. We demonstrate this claim using simulated data as well as data from the Palomar Transient Factory data release 2. This method has important implications for multi-epoch seeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing, galaxy shape measurements, and diffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.\n",12,

Much work has been done in applying one such algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to spectra, but PCA assumes that the data is linear globally, which is not the case for spectral data. Other work has been done to examine the possibilities of applying nonlinear dimension reduction algorithms, such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Isometric Mapping (Isomap). These algorithms only require local linearity in the data, which is satisfied by spectral data. We apply PCA, LLE and Isomap to spectra of K-type stars from SDSS, and use a trained Support Vector Machine to determine subclasses of these stars. We then compare these subclasses to those given by SDSS to determine the accuracy of the classifications. This allows us to compare the classification accuracies of PCA, LLE, and Isomap.\n",18,

Stacey,Sessioned,"University of Minnesota, Morris; Cornell University","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): HII regions are areas of singly ionized Hydrogen formed by the ionizing radiaiton of upper main sequence stars. The infrared fine-structure line emissions, particularly Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Neon, can give important information about HII regions including gas temperature and density, elemental abundances, and the effective temperature of the stars that form them. The processes involved in calculating this information from observational data are complex. Models, such as those provided in Rubin 1984 and those produced by Cloudy (Ferland et al, 2013) enable one to extract physical parameters from observational data. However, the multitude of search parameters can make sifting through models tedious. I digitized Rubin’s models and wrote a Python program that is able to take observed line ratios and their uncertainties and find the Rubin or Cloudy model that best matches the observational data. By creating a Python script that is user friendly and able to quickly sort through models with a high level of accuracy, this work increases efficiency and reduces human error in matching HII region models to observational data.\n",21,

R. Sandford*,N. R. Sandford*; Y. Lu,Sessioned,"Pomona College; The Observatories, The Carnegie Institution for Science","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The metallicity gradients of disc galaxies contain valuable information about the physics governing their formation and evolution. The observed metallicity profiles have negative gradients that are steeper at high redshifts, indicating an inside-out formation of disc galaxies. We improve on our semi-analytic galaxy formation model (<i>Lu, Mo & Wechsler 2015</i>) by incorporating the radial distribution of metals into the model. With the improved model, we explore how feedback scenarios affect metallicity gradients. The model features 3 feedback scenarios: An Ejective (EJ) model, which includes ejective supernova (SN) feedback, a PRe-Heating (PR) model, which assumes that the intergalactic medium is preheated, preventing it from collapsing onto galaxies, and a Re-Incorporation (RI) model, which also includes strong outflows but allows ejected gas to re-accrete onto the galaxies. We compare the models with observations from <i>Ho et al. (2015)</i> and find that while all models struggle to match the observed metallicity gradient-stellar mass relationship, the PR model predicts metallicity gradients that best match observations. We also find that the RI model predicts a flat gradient because its outflow and re-accretion replenish the disc uniformly with newly accreted enriched gas, erasing the mark of inside-out formation. Our findings suggest feedback plays a key role in shaping the metallicity gradients of disc galaxies and require more detailed theoretical modeling to understand them.\n",3,

While many current models can match the properties of these objects at z ~ 2-3, all current models severely underestimate their abundances at z~5.  We study the ability of a semi-analytic model to match the line density of damped systems and find that serious changes to the model must be made.  If gas disks give rise to these systems, then more baryons must be in HI than is currently assumed in the model, either because fewer stars are formed or less gas is ejected by supernova.  In addition, the disks must be much larger than assumed in the model.  Alternatively, gas outflows could account for much of the cross section, placing constraints on the physics of supernova feedback.\n",4,

Our motivations are two-fold: (1) presenting a new, promising technique to study galaxy formation, and (2) quantitatively evaluating the extent of the influence of dark matter halo properties on small-scale structure formation. For our analyses, we use both semi-analytical models (Millennium simulation) and N-body + hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris simulation). The ML algorithms are trained on important dark matter halo properties (inputs) and galaxy properties (outputs). The trained models are able to robustly predict the gas mass, stellar mass, black hole mass, star formation rate, $g-r$ color, and stellar metallicity. Moreover, the ML simulated galaxies obey fundamental observational constraints implying that the population of ML predicted galaxies is physically and statistically robust. Next, ML algorithms are trained on an N-body + hydrodynamical simulation and applied to an N-body only simulation (Dark Sky simulation, Illustris Dark), populating this new simulation with galaxies. We can examine how structure formation changes with different cosmological parameters and are able to mimic a full-blown hydrodynamical simulation in a computation time that is orders of magnitude smaller. We find that the set of ML simulated galaxies in Dark Sky obey the same observational constraints, further solidifying ML’s place as an intriguing and promising technique in future galaxy formation studies and rapid mock galaxy catalog creation.\n",5,

This shortcoming in our theoretical picture is largely driven by an inability to understand the physics of satellite (or “environmental”) quenching. Using abundance matching prescriptions to populate large dissipationless N-body simulations, including the Bolshoi Simulation, we study the dependence of satellite properties on cluster-centric distance within massive host halos at z < 1.5, focusing on the potential physical mechanisms that may be at play in suppressing star formation in the satellite population.

However key questions, such as the role of SF and AGN in powering the IR output of galaxies remain unanswered. The large numbers of high redshift galaxies detected by recent IR surveys make individual spectroscopic follow-up impractical. However statistical trends in SED and luminosity function evolution in an entire population can be realized. We present a new open source Markov-Chain Monte Carlo code, SurveySim. It is built to constrain the spectral energy distribution and luminosity function evolution required to produce a given multi-wavelength survey. Its very general design allow us to use a wide range of different dusty galaxy populations (including SFGs, AGNs and Composites), luminosity function forms and SED templates. The code employs a multidimensional color-color diagnostic to determine goodness of fit. It simulates observational errors and takes into account incompleteness.

Ram pressure stripping, the removal of a galaxy’s gas through direct interaction with the gas halo in which it orbits, is an attractive quenching mechanism, particularly in the Milky Way halo where the radial distribution of quenching is dramatic. However, many implementations of this process in semi-analytic models result in overly-rapid gas removal when compared with observations. We use high resolution hydrodynamical simulations run with Enzo to parameterize the stripping of disk and halo gas from an orbiting satellite galaxy for use in the semi-analytic modeling code Galacticus. We find that using the instantaneous ram pressure overestimates the amount of gas that is stripped, and present a physically-motivated module for including ram pressure stripping in semi-analytic models that uses the integral of the ram pressure experienced by a satellite galaxy.

Observations show that velocity dispersion increases with stellar age. This trend is thought to be due to a combination of the evolution of the velocity dispersion of the interstellar media (ISM), interactions within the disk, and galactic mergers. Our simulated galaxies show redshift zero age-velocity dispersion relations consistent with those of observed galaxies. In order to determine how the velocity dispersion of stars evolves after their formation, we calculated the velocity dispersion versus the age of the stars at both redshift zero and at their time of formation. We found that while the ISM velocity dispersion evolves, it cannot be the sole source of the relation. Additionally, dwarf galaxies display a greater relative change in their velocity dispersion than more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we show that major mergers markedly increase the velocity dispersion of stars.\n",12,

The system tests appear in spectra as RFI (radio frequency interference) at 1381MHz, which contaminates observations of extragalactic HI (atomic hydrogen) signals at 50-150 Mpc. Test durations last roughly 20-120 seconds and can occur upwards of 30 times during a single night of observing. The disruption essentially renders the corresponding HI spectra useless.<br /><br />We present a method that automatically removes RFI in HI spectra caused by these tests. By capitalizing on the GPS system's short test durations and predictable frequency appearance we are able to devise a method of identifying times containing compromised data records. By reevaluating the remaining data, we are able to recover clean spectra while sacrificing little in terms of sensitivity to extragalactic signals. This method has been tested on 500+ spectra taken by the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team (UAT), in which it successfully identified and removed all sources of GPS RFI.

This subset is consistent with having an r^–1 power-law surface density distribution and a radial velocity distribution both centered on M87. The remote M87 GC satellites span the radial range 140 to 900 kpc, out to about a third of the Virgo Cluster's virial radius (for comparison, M87's effective radius is only 8 kpc). These M87 GC satellites are probably former satellites of other Virgo Cluster galaxies that have subsequently been cannibalized by M87.<br /><br />This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program.\n",23,

Kim*,D. Kim*; R. A. Jansen; R. A. Windhorst,Sessioned,Arizona State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We analyze the intrinsic flux ratios of simple and composite stellar populations for various visible--near-infrared filters with respect to ∼3.5μm (L-band), and their dependence on metallicity, star-formation history, and effective mean age. This study is motivated by the fact that light from galaxies is reddened and attenuated by dust via scattering and absorption, where different sightlines across the face of a galaxy suffer various amounts of extinction. Ignoring the effects of this extinction could lead one to infer lower stellar mass, and SFR, or higher metallicity. Tamura et al. (2009) developed an approximate method, dubbed the ""β<sub>V</sub>"" method, which corrects for dust-extinction on a pixel-by-pixel basis, by comparing the observed flux ratio and empirical estimate of the intrinsic flux ratio of optical and ∼3.5μm broadband data. Here, we aim to validate and test the limits of the β<sub>V</sub> method for various filters spanning the visible through near-infrared wavelength range. Through extensive modeling, we test their assumptions for the intrinsic flux ratios for a wide variety of simple and composite stellar populations. We build spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of simple stellar populations (SSPs), by adopting Starburst99 and BC03 models for young (<9Myr) and old (>100Myr) stellar populations, respectively, and linear combinations of these for intermediate ages. We then construct composite stellar population (CSP) SEDs by combining SSP SEDs for various realistic star-formation histories (SFHs). We convolve filter response curves of visible--near-infrared filters for <i>HST</i> imaging surveys and mid-infrared filters in current (<i>WISE</i>, <i>Spitzer</i>/IRAC) and near<br />-future use (<i>JWST</i>/NIRCam) with each model SED, to obtain intrinsic flux ratios (β<sub>λ,0</sub>). We find that β<sub>NIR,0</sub> is only varying slightly as a function of metallicity but is insensitive to SFH or redshift (z≤2). We also find a narrow range of β<sub>V,0</sub> (0.7<sup>+0.05</sup><sub>-0.08</sub>) for early Hubble type galaxies (E and S0) using SEDs of randomly generated multi-burst SFHs together with age and metallicity profiles of nearby galaxies from the literature.\n",24,

Our new sample, which is based on the catalog of nearby merging galaxies from the SIGS sample (Spitzer Interacting Galaxy Sample; Lanz et al. 2013, 2014), cross-correlates the Revised IRAC-FSC Redshift Catalogue (Wang et al. 2014) with Galaxy Zoo, which builds on and extends the previous investigation by Lanz et al. in two ways. First it enlarges the sample considerably, increasing the statistical power of the analysis significantly. Second, it includes galaxies in the most advanced merger stage, filling a potential gap in the Lanz et al. sample. The cross-correlation gave 453 possible mergers, between 400 and 453 of which are interacting on some level. After more clearly defining the evolutionary stages of the merging process, these galaxies’ stages were identified morphologically, and selected according to brightness () and stage (late stages 4-6), more than tripling the total late-stage sample to about 40 or 50 systems, 16 of which have sufficient observational data for a full SED analysis. These, along with the late-stage mergers found in the SIGS sample, have been photometered from the ultraviolet (UV) to the far-infrared (FIR) and subsequently fit and analyzed by the newly revised and updated CIGALE (Code Investigating Galaxy Emission; Burgarella et al. 2005) in order to retrieve key physical properties of the galaxies including star-formation rate (SFR), AGN fraction, and stellar and dust mass, as well as identify any trends in terms of shape and physical properties of spectra within the evolutionary range of late-stage mergers.\n",25,

In our observations we detected a highly compact radio source with an extent of 21.14 parsecs. For each of two detected radio components, we measured their flux density and spectral index. By looking at their spectra, we concluded our radio detection to be a Compact Steep-Spectrum object (CSS), indicating a young radio object less than a few thousand years in age.

The galaxies with higher star formation rates also tend to have greater SMBH-associated X-ray luminosities, perhaps suggestive of a mutual dependence on cold gas.

Galloway,Sessioned,University of Minnesota,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): It is well known that the mass-size distribution evolves as a function of cosmic time and that this evolution is different between passive and star-forming galaxy populations. However, the devil is in the details and the precise evolution is still a matter of debate since this requires careful comparison between similar galaxy populations over cosmic time while simultaneously taking into account changes in image resolution, rest-frame wavelength, and surface brightness dimming in addition to properly selecting representative morphological samples.<br />Here we present the first step in an ambitious undertaking to calculate the bivariate mass-size distribution as a function of time and morphology. We begin with a large sample (~3 x 10<sup>5</sup>) of SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1. Morphologies for this sample have been determined by Galaxy Zoo crowdsourced visual classifications and we split the sample not only by disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies but also in finer morphology bins such as bulge strength. Bivariate distribution functions are the only way to properly account for biases and selection effects. In particular, we quantify the mass-size distribution with a version of the parametric Maximum Likelihood estimator which has been modified to account for measurement errors as well as upper limits on galaxy sizes.\n",28,

To study the offset, we have selected a sample of local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS-III/BOSS DR12), which occupies the same space in the [N II]λ6584/Hα vs. [O III]λ5007/Hβ diagnostic diagram as the z~2 sample.

Physical properties such as star formation rate and metallicity can be determined from ratios of emission line fluxes. The study of emission line galaxies (ELGs) through cosmic time gives insight into the processes by which galaxies evolve. Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs), typified by strong nebular emission lines which dominate their spectra, are of interest because they are well known to be galaxies undergoing periods of intense star formation. Slitless grism spectroscopy offers a significant advantage to the study of ELGs and EELGs, allowing for measurement of the spectra of a large number of galaxies within a field. This allows for detection of ELGs and EELGs with few selection biases. Optical follow-up of FIGS-selected sources allows for analysis of star formation rate (SFR) through H-alpha measurements over the redshift range 0.3<z<0.75 and analysis of mass-metalicity relations, using the gas phase oxygen abundance found with [OII], [OIII], and H-beta fluxes to infer metallicity, over the range 0.3<z<1.3.\n",34,

X-ray studies on the Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) activity indicate the existence of a Black Hole Accretion Rate (BHAR) “main sequence”, similar to the “main sequence” observed in star-forming galaxies, between the star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*). We use the multi wavelength data from the SIMES survey to study the optical to sub-mm spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies identified at 250 μm by the Herschel Space Observatory. In particular, for galaxies in the 0.2–1.5 redshift range, we explore the relations among galaxy’s stellar mass, SFR, and SMBH accretion rate. The deep Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS (3.6, 4.5 and 24 μm) together with the deep AKARI-IRC observations (7, 11 and 15 μm) allow us to constrain the critical spectral region where the dusty torus emission of AGNs is more prominent. Thanks to the Herschel-SPIRE observations, we can also precisely measure the SFR from the bolometric (i.e. 8-1000 μm) far-IR emission. Using this multi-wavelength approach we confirm the existence, at z<0.5, of the M*-BHAR “main sequence”. The measured average ratio between BHAR and SFR is close to the value required to maintain the SMBH-to-M* ratio of ∼10<sup>3</sup> and decreases at higher specific SFRs (SSFR=SFR/M*). Finally, combining our observations with literature results, we show that the slope of the BHAR main sequence is evolving with redshift between z~0 and z~2.\n",37,

Visual classifications are calibrated using a set of z≈0.05 SDSS images that are processed to appear as they would at a variety of simulated redshifts using Hubble; this measures the morphological bias for galaxies as a function of changing the apparent size and brightness, without overcorrecting for effects such as an evolving L<sup>star</sup>. We present a new technique for debiasing the morphologies based on a simple parametric model of surface brightness and distance, which adjusts the threshold for detecting feature or disk-dominated galaxies in fainter galaxies and at higher redshifts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for bulge/disk separation, and discuss its applications and limitations for smaller physical sub-structures. We also present preliminary results analyzing the evolution of disk sub-structure as a function of cosmic time. All the above data will be included in the upcoming release of the full Galaxy Zoo: Hubble catalog.\n",41,

Each galaxy received an average of 43 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively down-weighting significantly errant classifications. Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous human and machine classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; in some cases the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of ""smooth"" galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless disks at 1 ≤ z ≤ 2, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disk galaxies seen at later epochs.<br />\n",42,

With this spectroscopy we can detect key rest-frame optical emission lines for galaxies out to z~1.7. In this talk, I will focus on the subset of 123 galaxies selected in the far-infrared with Herschel. These galaxies are highly obscured and known to have a high AGN fraction based on detections at other wavelengths. This is the largest sample of infrared galaxies with near-infrared spectroscopy at these redshifts. The far-infrared selection results in a sample of galaxies that are massive systems that span a range of metallicities in comparison with previous optically selected surveys, and thus has a higher AGN fraction and better samples the AGN branch. Using this sample, and other optically selected samples, we investigate how the BPT diagram evolves over time and how this evolution agrees with the prediction of the models of Kewley et al. 2013. We find that a large fraction of our IR-selected sample are BPT-selected AGN using their new, redshift dependent classification line and find large agreement with other methods of identifying AGN. Additionally, we identify new, likely obscured AGN that were not identified at other wavelengths and discuss the properties of these objects in detail.\n",43,

Within the common area of ∼172 deg<sup>2</sup> we have identified the far-infrared counterparts for 354 quasars, among which 134 are highly secure detections in the <i>Herschel</i> 250μm band (signal-to-noise ratios ≥5). This sample is the largest far-infrared quasar sample of its kind, and spans a wide redshift range of 0.14≤z≤4.7. Their far-infrared spectral energy distributions, which are due to the cold dust components within the host galaxies, are consistent with being heated by active star formation. In most cases (>∼80%), their total infrared luminosities as inferred from only their far-infrared emissions (L<sub>IR</sub><sup>(cd)</sup>) already exceed 10<sup>12</sup> L<sub>sun</sub>, and thus these objects qualify as ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. There is no correlation between L<sub>IR</sub><sup>(cd)</sup> and the absolute magnitudes, the black hole masses or the X-ray luminosities of the quasars, which further support that their far-infrared emissions are not due to their active galactic nuclei. A large fraction of these objects (>∼50-60%) have star formation rates >∼300M<sub>sun</sub>/yr. Such extreme starbursts among optical quasars, however, is only a few per cent. This fraction varies with redshift, and peaks at around z~2. Among the entire sample, 136 objects have secure estimates of their cold-dust temperatures (T), and we find that there is a dramatic increasing trend of T with increasing L<sub>IR</sub><sup>(cd)</sup>.

All of our sources have low-resolution <i>Spitzer</i>/IRS spectra -- the largest such sample outside the local universe. These spectra allow us to determine that our sample consists of a mixture of star forming galaxies (SFGs), AGN, and composites. We address the question of how well do empirical IR AGN fraction estimates trace the intrinsic AGN fraction (i.e. the AGN-to-total power in the galaxy prior to dust re-processing), including how they relate to galaxy properties such as merger stage, dust/gas content, and star formation rates. We do this by fitting the observed SEDs of our sample with theoretical SEDs based on GADGET hydrodynamic merger simulations additionally processed through the SUNRISE radiative transfer code. We additionally investigate systematic uncertainties associated with these quantities using the goodness of fits to our model library. The key findings are: 1) our simulation-based fits are in broad agreement with the empirical model-based fits, 2) much of the AGN fraction of L<sub>IR</sub> is missed if the AGN's contribution to heating the host galaxy dust is not accounted for, and 3) the IR AGN fraction traces the intrinsic AGN fraction up to the coalescence stage, however may underestimate the intrinsic AGN fraction post coalescence.\n",45,

However, observations in this epoch remain challenging and are limited to the brightest galaxies; the fainter sources believed to be responsible for reionizing the Universe remain beyond the grasp of Hubble. With gravitational lensing, however, we can benefit from the magnification of faint sources, which brings them within reach of today's telescopes. The Hubble Frontier Fields program is a deep survey of strongly lensing clusters observed in the optical and near-infrared. Unfortunately, detecting highly magnified, intrinsically faint galaxies in these fields has proved challenging due to the bright foregound cluster galaxies and intracluster light. We have developed a technique using wavelet decomposition to overcome these difficulties and detect galaxies at z~7 with intrinsic UV magnitudes as faint as M<sub>UV</sub> = -13. We present this method and the resulting luminosity functions, which support a steep faint-end slope extending out to the observational limits.

Salzer,Sessioned,George Mason University; University of San Francisco; Macalester College; Indiana University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Low-mass galaxies dominate the universe by number and many of these systems have large star formation rates per unit mass. Measurements of the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from dwarf galaxies are an important input to cosmological simulations and theoretical studies but are largely unconstrained by observations. As a result, the role of low-mass galaxies in cosmological reionization and the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high and low redshifts remains poorly understood. Here we study a sample of 18 star-forming galaxies (12 from the Lyman-Alpha Reference Sample, Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2015; 6 from the KISS sample, Salzer et al. 2001), some of which are low-mass systems (10 with M_star < 5 x 10^9 M_sun). All of the sample galaxies were observed in the FUV with the HST/COS spectrograph and these measurements were used to derive limits on their escaping Lyman-alpha radiation (Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2015, Wofford et al. 2013). Using the numerical radiative transfer simulations of Yajima et al. 2014, we relate the escape of Lyman-alpha radiation to limits on the fraction of escaping H-ionizing radiation from these galaxies. This correlation is stronger for low-redshift galaxies (Yajima et al. 2014) and these galaxies are more accessible observationally for these studies. Although the Yajima et al. (2014) study focuses on high-mass galaxies, we derive tentative limits on the escape fraction for H-ionizing radiation for all of the galaxies in this sample. From our analysis, we find escape fractions of less than 5% in all but two extreme cases where the escape fractions are greater than 14%. Our sample averaged escape fraction is insufficient for what reionization requires, although our values are likely to be lower limits and the two outliers are two of the lowest mass systems from the LARS sample. We discuss future directions, including further modeling of the radiative transfer and the galaxy’s physical conditions, to better understand the role of dwarf galaxies in the ionization of the local IGM and cosmic reionization.\n",54,

The APOGEE-2 YSO Young Cluster Program aims to measure the dynamics and star formation history uniformly across the full extent of the Orion star forming complex, based on thousands of high-resolution H-band spectra that APOGEE-2 will obtain of candidate Orion members. We utilize data from wide-field photometric surveys to select candidate YSOs throughout Orion via two complementary techniques. We follow the Koenig et al. (2014) criteria by using WISE+2MASS data to identify YSOs with IR excesses due to warm circumstellar dust; we also use multi-epoch optical PanSTARRS photometry to identify variable YSOs both with and without circumstellar disks (or circumstellar materials). The IR excess technique identifies 1729 candidates brighter than H=12.8 mag, a limit selected to ensure a minimum S/N > 50 for a typical 3-hour APOGEE exposure. selecting sources which display significant variability in at least 3 PanSTARRS bands similarly produces a preliminary sample of 1500 candidates with H<12.8 mag. In total, we identify nearly 2700 YSO candidates, 450 of which were identified via both selection methods. The resulting catalog exhibits clear spatial over-densities associated with known sub-regions of Orion such as the ONC, sigma Ori and L1641, and provides a uniform catalog for spectroscopic targeting over Orion's full 250+ sq. degree footprint.\n",2,

The location of first carbon ignition, quenching location of the carbon burning flames and flashes, angular frequency of the carbon core, and carbon core mass are studied as a function of the ZAMS mass, initial rotation rate, and mixing parameters such as convective overshoot, semiconvection, thermohaline and angular momentum transport. We find the properties of carbon burning in SAGB models are not a strong function of the initial rotation profile, but are a sensitive function of the strength of overshoot mixing. Increasing the amount of overshoot decreases the initial mass needed for off center and center carbon ignitions. Carbon burning flames show a range of morphologies, which vary as a function of initial mass and convective overshoot strength, with either a series of flashes or a flame which propagates inwards towards the core. We find that only systems with overshoot values ≥0.01 and zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses ≈7.2-8.0 M<sub>⊙</sub> is carbon burning quenched at a significant distance from the center.

High resolution L-Band spectra were obtained using the Phoenix infrared spectrometer on the Kitt Peak National Observatory Mayall 4m telescope. Chlorine is thought to be primarily produced in explosive oxygen burning but stellar chlorine abundances are virtually unknown. We measured the 35Cl abundance from an HCl feature at 3.69 microns.<br /><br />Analysis of our full sample of giants and dwarfs found the HCl feature is only present in stars with temperatures below 3900K. The [Cl/Fe] abundances in stars with solar metallicity matches the abundance seen in the Sun. Measurements of the [Cl/O] ratio in our sample stars is also consistent with [Cl/O] ratios found in planetary nebulae and H II regions. Our measured abundances are all within one standard deviation, 0.3 dex on average, and are consistent with current chemical evolution models for chlorine in the solar neighborhood. A slight decrease in [Cl/Fe] abundance as [Fe/H] increases may be present and must be verified with future Cl abundances measurements in lower metallicity stars. The average [Cl/Fe] ratio in our sample is -0.07 with a standard deviation of 0.13. An upper limit to the 37Cl isotope abundance in the star RZ Ari, measured from a feature at 3.70 microns, puts a lower limit of 2.5 on the Cl 35/37 isotope ratio for this star. This ratio is consistent with the solar system value of 35/37=3.11.\n",6,

Cardillo*,H. Cardillo*; D. L. Burris,Sessioned,University of Central Arkansas,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Elements with atomic number greater than Z=26 (the Iron Peak) cannot be formed through fusion in a star’s core; the majority of these elements are produced through one of two neutron-capture processes.  Early in the history of the Galaxy, the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is believed to be responsible for the production of elements Z=56 and beyond. These elements require at least one generation of stars to have completed their life cycle in order to be synthesized.  Therefore, if we observe the heavy metal abundances in what are called Population II stars (metal-poor stars), then we can begin to make inferences about the chemistry of the earliest stars in the Galaxy.  <br />    To contribute to this picture of the early universe, the Lanthanum and Europium abundances of low-metallicity stars will be measured and trends in these abundances based on comparisons to existing related literature will be sought.<br /><br />\n",7,

For this study we analyzed high resolution, high signal-to-noise HST/STIS and VLT/UVES spectra over a total wavelength range 2300-7000 Å. We employed only recent or newly-applied reliable laboratory transition data for all species. Abundances from more than 600 lines of non-Fe species were combined with about 550 Fe lines in HD 84937 to yield abundance ratios of high precision. From parallel analyses of solar photospheric spectra we also derived new solar abundances of these elements. This in turn yielded internally-consistent relative HD 84937 abundances with respect to the Sun. For seven of the ten Fe-group elements the HD 84937 abundances were from both neutral and ionized transitions. In all of these cases the neutral and ionized species yield the same abundances within the measurement uncertainties. Therefore standard Saha ionization balance appears to hold in the HD 84937 atmosphere. We derived metallicity [Fe/H] = -2.32 with sample standard deviation of 0.06. Solid evidence is seen for departures from the solar abundance mix in HD 84937, for example [Co/Fe] = +0.14, [Cu/Fe] = -0.83, and <[Sc,Ti,V/Fe]> = +0.31. Combining our Sc, Ti, and V abundances for this star with those from large-sample spectroscopic surveys suggests that these elements are positively correlated in stars with [Fe/H] < -2. HD 84937 is unusually enriched in Sc, Ti, and V. Our analysis strongly suggests that different types of supernovae with a large scatter of explosion energies and asymmetries contributed to the creation of the Fe-group elements early in the Galaxy's history.<br /><br />This work has been supported in part by NASA grant NNX10AN93G (J.E.L.), by NSF grants AST-1211055 (J.E.L.), AST-1211585 (C.S.), PHY-1430152 (through JINA, J.J.C. and M.P.), EU MIRGCT-2006-046520 (M.P.), and by the ``Lendlet-2014'' Programme of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (M.P.) and from SNF (Switzerland, M.P.).\n",8,

LeBleu,Sessioned,Louisiana State Univ.; Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris; McMaster University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are rare hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants. Two evolutionary scenarios have been suggested, a double degenerate merger of two white dwarfs, or a final helium shell flash in a PN central star. The evidence pointing toward a white-dwarf merger or a final-flash origin for RCB stars is contradictory. The distribution on the sky and radial velocities of the RCB stars tend toward those of the bulge population but a much larger sample of stars is needed to determine the true population. We need to discover RCB stars much more efficiently. In order to do this, we have used a series of IR color-color cuts, using the recent release of the WISE All-Sky Catalog, to produce a sample of 2200 candidates that may yield over 200 new RCB star identifications. Most of these candidates do not have lightcurves, the traditional technique of identifying RCB stars from their characteristic large and irregular light variations. We have obtained optical spectra of several hundred candidates and have confirmed over 40 new RCB stars in the Galaxy. We are attempting to develop a quantitative spectral classification system for the RCB stars so that they can be identified without an accompanying light curve. The cooler RCB stars look like carbon stars with strong C<sub>2</sub> bands, but they can be differentiated from carbon stars by their extreme hydrogen deficiency and very low <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio. Also, the red CN bands are much weaker in RCB stars than in carbon stars. The number of RCB stars in the Galaxy may be consistent with the predicted number of He/CO white-dwarf mergers. Solving the mystery of how the RCB stars evolve would be a watershed event in the study of stellar evolution that will lead to a better understanding of other important types of stellar merger events such as Type Ia SNe.\n",10,

To advance, the field of visible-light interferometry requires development of instruments capable of combining more than just two or three beams at once. The Visible Imaging System for Interferometric Observations at NPOI (VISION) is a new visible light beam combiner for the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) that uses single-mode fibers to coherently combine light from up to <br />six telescopes simultaneously with an image-plane combination scheme. It features a photometric camera for calibrations, and spatial filtering from single-mode fibers with two Andor Ixon electron multiplying CCDs. Here we present the VISION system, results of laboratory tests, and results of commissioning on-sky observations. We determine a new set of corrections to the power spectrum and bispectrum when using an electron-multipying CCD to measure visibility and closure phase, by taking into account non-Gaussian statistics and read noise, as required by our post-processing pipeline. We verify our post-processing pipeline via new on-sky observations of the O-type supergiant binary Zeta Orionis A, obtaining a flux ratio, position angle  and separation in good agreement with expectations from the previously published orbit.\n",13,

Star A has an optical B0III companion 2.4 arcsec away, MWC349B. Previous studies suggest A & B are either gravitationally bound, and therefore both a few Myr old, or not bound and A is possibly an observable 30 M<sub>solar</sub> star in its pre-main sequence stage. We attempt to solve the controversy by measuring the difference of radial velocities between A and B using observations from the 1.5m Tillinghast telescope and the TRES spectrometer at the Whipple Observatory. With an assumed distance of 1.2 kpc and masses of ~30 M<sub>solar</sub>, the radial velocities cannot differ by >3 km/s for the stars to be gravitationally bound. We find a radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest of 42 ± 18 km/s for B, and compare it with the known radial velocity of 8 ± 2 km/s for A giving a difference of 34 ± 20 km/s - much greater than 3 km/s. We conclude that A and B are not gravitationally bound, although light contamination from star A in B’s spectrum makes this result somewhat inconclusive. If confirmed, however, the known spectral type of B will not determine the age of star A and star A may be an observable 30 M<sub>solar</sub> star in its pre-main sequence stage.

Lee*,H. Lee*; C. Cartwright,Sessioned,The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): There is mounting evidence that almost all the Milky Way globular clusters (MWGCs) are of multiple stellar populations.  Several earlier works have revealed that the color-magnitude diagrams of MWGCs are best reproduced by the combination of stellar populations with different ages and metallicities.  However, their integrated spectrophotometric properties have not yet been validated.  In this work, we employ the most up-to-dated stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones from several different groups and calculate the integrated broadband colors and spectral indices for the Milky Way globular clusters and compare the theoretical predictions to the observations.\n",26,

Suwannajak*,C. Suwannajak*,Sessioned,University of Florida,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present deep HST/ACS photometry of an arclike, overdense region of stars in the southern halo of M82, located approximately 5 kpc from its disk. This arc feature was originally identified about a decade ago. The early ground-based studies suggested that it contains young stars with ages and metallicities similar to those that formed in the tidal tails between M81, M82, and NGC3077 during their interactions. The arc is clearly presented in the spatial distribution of stars in our field with significantly higher stellar density than the background M82 halo stars. The location of the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) reveals the arc to have a similar distance to M81 and M82, therefore confirming that it belongs to this interacting system. Combining our data with those from the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST), we construct a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the arc. A sequence of young stars is clearly presented on its CMD. This young main sequence is not seen in other parts of the M82 halo. Single-metallicity isochrones are used to derive the age of the young stars in the arc. We confirm that these stars exhibit ages consistent with young stars found in the HI bridges between M81, M82 and NGC3077. Furthermore, the mean metallicity of the RGB stars is also derived from their metallicity distribution function and found to be similar to that found in the HI bridges.\n",27,

Mehta*,V. Mehta*; T. V. Le,Sessioned,Berry College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief flashes of gamma-rays occurring at an average rate of a few per day throughout the universe, and it is generally assumed that GRB follows star formation rate. The ultimate energy source of a GRB is believed to be associated with an exploding star that is in a process of forming a black hole, and a high amount of energy is expected to be released during this process. Evidence of jetted GRBs (jet opening-angle) can also be observed from radio and optical observations of achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curves. Two different redshift (z) distributions were observed from different space observatories, the Swift and preSwift missions, however, the jet opening-angle distribution was determined only by the pre-Swift satellites prior to 2007. Le & Dermer (2007) developed a flat GRB spectrum model for long-duration GRBs to fit the redshift (z) and the jet openingangle distributions measured with earlier GRB missions, and showed that GRBs do not follow star formation rate. However, their fitted results were obtained without using the opening-angle distribution from the Swift sample. In this study we revisited the calculation done by Le & Dermer by refitting the redshift and the jet openingangle distribution measured from both pre-Swift and Swift satellites. We further explored how the broken power-law GRB spectrum affect the overall fitting of the redshift and the jet opening-angle distributions, and the results will be presented in this paper.\n",2,

West,Sessioned,East Central University; Harvard University; Lowell Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gamma Ray Burst (GRB’s), extremely energetic flashes of Gamma Rays, are caused by either deaths of massive unstable stars or colliding binary neutron stars. A unique burst, GRB 150518a, had two recorded bursts fifteen minutes apart which is very rare and is considered to be ultra-long, lasting around thirty minutes total and is associated with a Supernova explosion. GBR 150518a is also extremely close compared to the average burst being measured to have a redshift of .2, this is important to note because GRB’s measuring less than a redshift of .3 only are seen every ten years. Gamma rays are emitted by supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and quasars and by studying GRB’s it allows us to see more deeply into how these objects function. The first few days of GRB 150518as’ detected afterglow was plotted in different wavelengths, including optical, x-ray, radio, and infrared, in flux verses time.

Soderberg,Sessioned,University of the Pacific; Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) 150518A, discovered on 2015 May 18 by the MAXI and KONUS-Wind satellites, lasted for about 1000s, making it an important addition to the recently established class of very long duration GRBs. We report on the JVLA radio observations of the afterglow of GRB 150518A. Additionally, we report the analysis of Xray afterglow observations by Swift-XRT. Multi-band light curves of the radio afterglow display an unusual, conspicuous rise around 10 days after the burst, possibly due to enhanced mass-loss from the progenitor in the final stages of evolution before the GRB. The X-ray afterglow spectrum is significantly soft (photon index Γx > 3) and heavily absorbed (NHx,i > 8 × 10^{21}/cm^2). These properties suggest peculiar behavior that is different from the predictions of the standard fireball model of GRBs. In the light of these properties, we compare different models of progenitors for very long duration GRBs.

The dust and gas properties of distant galaxies can be characterized by studying the absorption features produced by them along the sightlines to luminous background quasars. Based on our prior finding that silicate dust absorption in z<1.5 quasar absorption systems exhibits a range of optical depths and absorption feature substructures, suggestive of silicate grain property variations, we are investigating silicate dust absorption in quasar absorption systems toward quasars with archival Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra. We present our measurements of the 10 and/or 18 micron silicate dust absorption feature(s) in these systems, and discuss constraints on the grain properties, such as composition and crystallinity, based on the shape and substructure present in these features. We also investigate the correlations between the silicate dust properties and the reddening. Connections between the silicate dust and gas phase metal absorption properties can also be probed for some of our targets with archival ground-based spectra. These relationships will yield valuable insights into the star formation history and evolution of metals and dust.

We tested this assumption by studying likely analogs of these SFGs in archival HST grism spectroscopy with GALEX UV and ground-based optical images at the redshift range in which we can directly measure the rest-frame Lyman continuum (λ<912Å, LyC) emission. We selected ~1400 SFGs for study on the presence of strong Hα emission and strongly selected against those SFGs whose GALEX FUV photometry could be contaminated by low redshift interlopers along the line of sight to produce a sample of ~600 z~1 SFGs. We made no unambiguous detection of escaping Lyman continuum radiation in individual galaxies in this sample, and stacked the individual non-detections in order to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape fraction, f<sub>esc</sub><2% (3σ). We sub-divided this sample and stacked SFGs to measure upper limits to f<sub>esc</sub> with respect to stellar mass,luminosity and relative orientation. For z~1 high Hα equivalent width (EW>200Å) SFGs, we found for the first time an upper limit to f<sub>esc</sub><9%. We discuss the implications of these limits for the ionizing emissivity of high redshift SFGs during the epoch of reionization. We conclude that reionization by SFGs is only marginally consistent with independent Planck observations of the CMB electron scattering opacity unless the LyC escape fraction of SFGs increases with redshift <i>and</i> an unobserved population of faint (M<sub>UV</sub><-13 AB) SFGs contributes significantly to the UV background.\n",2,

Diaz*,R. Diaz*; G. Harp,Sessioned,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; SETI Institute","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): As electromagnetic (EM) waves from sources such as blazars travel through the intergalactic medium (IGM), they are slowed by electrons; a phenomenon called dispersion delay [2]. We study the propagation effects in emissions of EM waves from blazar source BL 0716+714 by estimating the average electron density, or dispersion measure (DM), of the IGM on a line of sight to the blazar. Measuring the variations in these effects with time allow us to understand the properties of the intervening material. Toward this goal we analyzed months of archived observations of BL 0716+714 taken by the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). The ATA’s correlator produces cross-power vs. frequency spectra for every baseline (distance between a pair of antennas) in ten-second intervals. To reduce this immense load of data we used a technique based on interferometry called bispectrum, which does not depend on complicated array calibration and simplifies our work. The bispectrum multiplies baselines, three at a time, so that they form a closed loop, then the cube root of spectra are averaged [1]. This technique is independent of phase errors associated with any individual antenna and has a better SNR ratio than simply taking the average of all the baselines. We developed a numerical analysis program that takes in archived blazar files containing correlation data, computes the bispectrum, and outputs FITS images for each day of observations. The results show that our observations do not have sufficient sensitivity to reveal blazar variations in the frequency ranges that were studied. It is suggested that future observations at higher frequencies and/or with another telescope having greater sensitivity would reveal the time/frequency dependence of emission structure that would allow measurements of electron content. This work shows that but bispectrum is a useful tool for rapid characterization of interferometer data that does not require interferometer caclibration which could introduce artifacts into radio light curves.<br /><br /><b>References:</b><br />[1] Law C.J. and Bower G.C.

These dust absorbers are searched from 39,242 Mg II absorbers with the absorption redshift 0.7≦ z(abs)≦ 2.67. The redshift range is chosen to allow 2DAs to be covered within SDSS spectrograph operation wavelength range (~3650-10,400 \AA\). We optimized our previously developed searching and identification procedures. The parameterized extinction curve is applied to fit the observation spectra with DR12 composite spectra (blue, average and red) in the rest-frame of Mg II absorbers. The best fitted spectra are used to extract bump parameters (width, depth and location). Only absorbers with bump strength above the 3σ level are chosen as 2DA candidates and used for statistical study. A total of over 400 2DA candidates have been identified as the first complete sample of 2DAs. In this sample, the bump strengths of most candidates are similar to the absorption bump observed in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC) and significantly weaker than those in the Milky Way (MW). The UV bump strength decreases with redshift. The UV bump strength is projected to evolve to the MW value at the present time. A subsample of these absorbers were observed with the MMT and Keck. All of them show strong dust depletion and high metallicity.

Meyer,Sessioned,University of Arkansas; Northwestern University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present a multi-epoch, high resolution (R ~ 100,000) study of ultraviolet interstellar C I absorption line profiles taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The 17 stars of this survey were chosen because each has high resolution spectra taken at least 10 years apart with the same instrument (STIS), grating (E140H), and aperture (0.2”x0.2”) thus minimizing the instrumental differences in the multi-epoch comparisons. Given the proper motions and distances of these stars, typically it was possible to observe variances in their C I line profiles which correspond to structure on scales of less than 200 AU. In 16 out of the 17 sightlines no significant differences in C I line profiles between the two epochs were detected (75% of the 68 C I velocity components were measured to vary less than 20% at the 2 σ level). A measurement of ~ 5% of sightlines with variances is consistent with the fraction found recently by McEvoy et al. (2015) in their much larger survey of multi-epoch variance of Na I in optical spectra. However, the sightline toward HD210809 did show significant variance in its C I line profile. The C I absorption arising from both the J = 1 and J = 2 fine-structure states toward this star exhibits variations at an LSR velocity of -37 km/s indicative of C I structure on a scale less than 200 AU. Interestingly, the sky position of HD 210809 corresponds to the edge of an intervening H I shell discovered by Suad et al. (2012) at this same LSR velocity. This connection is consistent with the optical survey of interstellar Na I by Meyer et al.

These residuals are distinct from the ""dark gas"", and persist despite accounting for other gas phases using dust maps or various measures. Given the goal to understand the underlying cosmic ray (CR) density, spectrum, and its spatial variation through the Galactic disk, the distribution and column density of the gas with which the CRs interact must be sensitively constrained. We present a study of the gamma-ray emission from the ρ Ophiuchi molecular cloud seen by Fermi, and compare this emission to a number of column density tracers, including near IR stellar extinction and dust emission. This nearby molecular cloud exhibits a broad dynamic range in extinction, notably atypical dust properties, and a number of embedded B stars which heat the dust and may also act as local CR sources\n",4,

Khatami*,D. Khatami*; P. F. Hopkins,Sessioned,Pomona College; Caltech,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present a numerical implementation of radiation hydrodynamics for the meshless code GIZMO. The radiation transport is treated as an anisotropic diffusion process combined with radiation pressure effects, photoionization with heating and cooling routines, and a multifrequency treatment of an arbitrary number of sources. As a first application of the method, we investigate the disruption of giant molecular clouds by stellar radiative feedback. Specifically, what fraction of the gas must a GMC convert into stars to cause self-disruption? We test a range of cloud masses and sizes with several source luminosities to probe the effects of photoheating and radiation pressure on timescales shorter than the onset of the first supernovae. Observationally, only ~1-10% of gas is converted into stars, an inefficiency that is likely the result of feedback from newly formed stars. Whether photoheating or radiation pressure dominates is dependent on the given cloud properties. For denser clouds, we expect photoheating to play a negligible role with most of the feedback driven by radiation pressure. This work explores the necessary parameters a GMC must have in order for radiation pressure to be the main disruption process.\n",6,

Oberg,Sessioned,University of Michigan; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the interstellar medium, formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO) has efficient formation pathways in both the gas-phase and on the surfaces of dust grains. Methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), on the other hand, is believed to form exclusively on grains as there are no efficient gas-phase reactions leading to CH<sub>3</sub>OH. We present observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope of several H<sub>2</sub>CO and CH<sub>3</sub>OH lines in a prestellar and protostellar core. We investigated the formation pathways of H<sub>2</sub>CO and CH<sub>3</sub>OH by comparing their spatial distributions. We find that in the prestellar core, the two species are anti-correlated in the densest region, while their emission is correlated in the low-density region. In contrast, for the protostellar core we find a correlation in the distribution of both species. We conclude that in the protostellar source, H<sub>2</sub>CO and CH<sub>3</sub>OH form together on grains and have been thermally desorbed due to the central newly formed star. In the prestellar core, however, CH<sub>3</sub>OH forms on the ices and remains depleted in the coldest regions, while H<sub>2</sub>CO can form efficiently in the gas-phase.

L. Thompson*,K. L. Thompson*; T. H. Troland; C. E. Heiles,Sessioned,Davidson College; University of Kentucky; UC Berkeley,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Although stars have long been known to form in the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, the details of the formation process are not well understood. There are many questions surrounding the formation mechanism of the clouds and the timescales on which they collapse. Star formation within the Galaxy has been found to be extremely inefficient, with stars forming at only 1-3% of the expected rate. Multiple theories addressing this inefficiency have emerged, placing varying degrees of emphasis on the magnetic fields and turbulence within the interstellar medium. One major difference in leading theories is the strength of the magnetic fields permeating the clouds and the extent to which they can provide support against cloud collapse. One way to determine the effect of magnetic fields is to determine the ratio between the gravitational and magnetic energies, called the mass-to-flux ratio, within the clouds to determine whether they are magnetically subcritical or supercritical. Much work has been done to determine this ratio in the cores of molecular clouds, but little is currently known about the fields in the envelopes of the clouds where most of the mass resides. We present the results of an extensive observational survey aimed at characterizing the fields in molecular clouds as a whole. We use the Arecibo telescope to determine mass-to-flux ratios in clouds distributed throughout the sky via the Zeeman effect in 18 cm OH absorption lines. This statistical study provides magnetic field and mass-to-flux results for 41 clouds located along 22 lines-of-sight. We find the first evidence for subcritical molecular gas along individual lines-of-sight, and a statistical analysis suggests that the mass-to-flux ratio in the envelopes of molecular clouds is approximately critical overall.\n",12,

We find extended radio continuum and radio recombination line (RRL) emission outside the PDR toward the north and east of the region. This suggests that a non-uniform PDR morphology is affecting the amount of radiation “leaking” through the PDR. We quantify the leaking photon fraction along the line of sight, and use a numerical model to estimate the leaking photon fraction in three dimensions of both radio continuum and H-alpha emission. We detect carbon RRL emission near the PDR and find a decrease in the helium-to-hydrogen ionic abundance ratio with increasing distance from the central position. This indicates a softening of the radiation field within the PDR. Using Herschel Space Observatory data, we create a dust temperature map of the region and show that small dust temperature enhancements to the north and east of NGC 7538 coincide with extended radio emission. We discuss implications for maintaining the ionization of the warm interstellar medium by HII regions.\n",13,

Gehret*,E. Gehret*; C. Battersby,Sessioned,Northern Arizona University; Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In general, current star formation theories successfully model the rate at which stars are forming throughout our Galaxy as well as others, with the star formation rate (SFR) in a given region being proportional to the amount of gas above a threshold density. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy is an excellent place to test these models. It is home to the highest amount of dense, molecular gas within our Galaxy–and yet, the SFR within this region is an order of magnitude lower than would be expected using current star formation models. This project utilizes data taken from the SMA Legacy Survey of the CMZ, in a search for gravitationally bound structures within three small gas clouds near the Galactic Center, as well as the 1.6 degree cloud. Dense gas structures are detected using H2CO–a dense gas tracer, and 1.3mm cold, dust continuum. These regions are catalogued using dendrograms to identify which structures have continuous and significant H2CO emission. Gravitationally bound candidates were identified by deriving each structure’s virial ratio. Within the three clouds near the GC, 40 structures were catalogued, with one structure that was found to be gravitationally bound. Very large virial ratios are the result of large H2CO line widths, possibly due to a high degree of tidal compression. This analysis is also performed on the 1.6 degree cloud, in a region with two suspected bound cores. One of these two cores is close to virial equilibrium and likely gravitationally bound, thus providing support for the use of this method on other clouds within the CMZ.

The WHAM Sky Survey (WHAM-SS) reaches sensitivity levels of about 0.1 R (EM ~ 0.2 pc cm^-6) with emission detected toward every direction in the sky. Each pointing of the survey comprises a spatially integrated spectrum from a one-degree beam on the sky covering at least 200 km/s around the Local Standard of Rest with 12 km/s spectral resolution. WHAM was designed primarily to study the pervasive warm ionized medium (WIM) component of the interstellar medium (ISM) but also reveals many large-scale, locally-ionized regions throughout the Galaxy. The WIM is a diffuse but thick component of the ISM that extends several kiloparsecs into the Galactic halo with a kinematic signature that traces the gaseous spiral arms of the Galaxy. In addition to this fairly smooth global emission, the Hα sky contains many individual H II regions and supernova remnants, a few revealed in the WHAM-SS for the first time. Some locations are dominated by complex filamentary network of diffuse ionized gas where the ISM has been shaped by past winds and supernovae and is now powered by a new wave of star formation. At high latitudes, faint emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is also regularly present. The success of WHAM as a fully remote observing facility for nearly two decades is due in no small part to the excellent and responsive support staff at KPNO in Arizona and CTIO in Chile. WHAM has been designed, built, and operated primarily through support of the National Science Foundation. The current research presented here is funded by award AST-1108911.\n",17,

The LNAs have been developed together with NGC in a 35 nm InP HEMT MMIC process. Recent results and a summary of best InP low noise amplifier data will be presented. This work describes technologies related to the detection and study of highly redshifted spectral lines from the CO molecule, a key tracer for molecular hydrogen. One of the most promising techniques for observing the Cosmic Dawn is intensity mapping of spectral-spatial fluctuations of line emission from neutral hydrogen (H I), CO, and [C II]. The essential idea is that instead of trying to detect line emission from individual galaxies, one measures the total line emission from a number of galaxies within the volume defined by a spectral-spatial pixel. Fluctuations from pixel to pixel trace large scale structure, and the evolution with redshift is revealed as a function of receiver frequency. A special feature of CO is the existence of multiple lines with a well-defined frequency relationship from the rotational ladder, which allows the possibility of cleanly separating the signal from other lines or foreground structure at other redshifts. Making use of this feature (not available to either HI or [C II] measurements) requires observing multiple frequencies, including the range 40–80 GHz, much of which is inaccessible from the ground or balloons.<br />Specifically, the J=1->0 transition frequency is 115 GHz; J=2->1 is 230 GHz; J=3->2 is 345 GHz, etc. At redshift 7, these lines would appear at 14.4, 28.8, and 43.2 GHz, accessible from the ground. Over a wider range of redshifts, from 3 to 7, these lines would appear at frequencies from 14 to 86 GHz. A ground-based CO Intensity mapping experiment, COMAP, will utilize InP-based HEMT MMIC amplifier front ends in the 30 GHz range. Higher frequencies which are difficult to observe from the ground will be necessary to realize the full scientific potential of redshifted CO emission, and results from the latest MMIC LNAs above 40 GHz will be presented here\n",1,

I will present predictions for the intensity map and power spectrum of the CO(1-0) line from z~2.4-2.8 galaxies, based on a parameterized model for the galaxy-halo connection, and demonstrate the extent to which properties of high-redshift galaxies can be directly inferred from such observations. Our fiducial prediction should be detectable by a realistic experiment, but motivated by significant model uncertainties, we demonstrate the effect on the power spectrum of varying each parameter in our model. Using simulated observations, we infer constraints on our model parameter space with an MCMC procedure, and show corresponding constraints on the LIR-LCO relation and the CO luminosity function. These constraints would be complementary to current high-redshift galaxy observations, which can detect the brightest galaxies but not complete samples from the faint end of the luminosity function. By probing these populations in aggregate, CO intensity mapping could be a valuable tool for probing molecular gas and its relation to star formation in high-redshift galaxies.\n",2,

These anisotropies trace spatial variations in integrated photon production, so measurements of EBL surface brightness fluctuations provide a complete census of the emission from stars summed over cosmic history. As a result, EBL fluctuations contain contributions from objects forming during the Epoch of Reionization (EOR), from the integrated galactic light (IGL), and faint, extended components such as intra-halo light (IHL) from stars tidally stripped from galaxies during merger events. Additional measurements with greater sensitivity, spectral range, and spectral resolution are required to disentangle these contributions.<br /><br />The Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment 2 (CIBER-2) is an instrument optimized for the measurement of near-infrared EBL anisotropies. As the Earth’s atmosphere generates time-varying near-infrared emission, CIBER-2 is launched on a sounding rocket from which it will carry out multiwavelength imaging in six spectral bands that span the visible to near-infrared. The 2.4 square degree images allow CIBER-2 to produce measurements of EBL fluctuations with high fidelity on large angular scales. The Lyman break feature from EOR sources provides a unique spectral feature which can be used to disentangle the high from the low redshift contributions to the anisotropy signal. Measurement in six independent wavebands allows detailed cross-correlation studies to constrain the source of the excess fluctuations at large angular scales. We provide an overview of the CIBER-2 instrument and explain CIBER-2 spectral feature identification and cross-correlation study methodologies.\n",3,

We explore the possibility of studying the redshifted far-IR fine-structure line emission using the three-dimensional (3D) power spectra obtained with an imaging spectrometer. The intensity mapping approach measures the spatio-spectral fluctuations due to line emission from all galaxies, including those below the individual detection threshold. The technique provides 3D measurements of galaxy clustering and moments of the galaxy luminosity function. Furthermore, the linear portion of the power spectrum can be used to measure the total line emission intensity including all sources through cosmic time with redshift information naturally encoded. As a case study, we consider measurement of [C II] autocorrelation in the 0.5 < z < 1.5 epoch, where interloper lines are minimized, using far-IR/submillimeter balloon-borne and future space-borne instruments with moderate and high sensitivity, respectively. In this context, we compare the intensity mapping approach to blind galaxy surveys based on individual detections. We find that intensity mapping is nearly always the best way to obtain the total line emission because blind, wide-field galaxy surveys lack sufficient depth and deep pencil beams do not observe enough galaxies in the requisite luminosity and redshift bins. Also, intensity mapping is often the most efficient way to measure the power spectrum shape, depending on the details of the luminosity function and the telescope aperture.\n",4,

We quantify biases and uncertainties in lens-derived quantities, such as the Hubble constant, that are associated with these external effects. Specifically, we build realistic three-dimensional mass configurations and examine different treatments of the environmental and line-of-sight effects. Fitting a simple external shear in the lens plane can account for tidal stretching from perturbing galaxies at the lens redshift or in the background, but cannot fully reproduce the more complicated effects from foreground perturbers. That approach also requires a separate correction for external convergence. A better approach is to employ our new framework for multi-plane lensing, which recovers lens model parameters without bias and to a precision limited only by the lens profile degeneracy and measurement noise. Our framework now accounts for underdense regions along sightline, avoiding biases in the Hubble constant. We show that lens systems with large ellipticities are less sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy than rounder lenses, producing stronger constraints on the Hubble constant.\n",2,

The observations provide a way of measuring the masses of the neutron star/black hole lenses. We also investigate possible future lensing events that would be caused if the compact object is orbited by dark companions, including exoplanets. Mesolensing events may be caused by exoplanets even if the compact object is unlikely to produce its own event.

The confidence level and accuracy of a time delay measurement in a given gravitational lens system depends on a combination of photometric precision, observational cadence, and the value of the time delay. While many such time differences have been measured, the absolute precision is rarely better than one day. To unlock the greatest potential of time delay probes, a greater than 100-fold improvement in precision is needed.<br /><br />In this contribution we describe a pilot ground-based campaign with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network, monitoring the four-image lensed quasar HE0435-1223. The LCOGT Network comprises nine 1-meter and two 2-meter telescopes at five sites, with optical imagers on all telescopes and low-dispersion optical spectrographs on the 2-meter telescopes. The geographical distribution of the network sites allows continuous coverage, and a single scheduler produces an optimal mapping of observation requests to the telescopes. Using network sites in Chile, Australia, and South Africa, we were able to obtain continuous optical images with a six-minute cadence over a period of 50 hours, with only one substantial gap due to bad weather at one site. Using a Bayesian-inference based analysis, we derive two plausible time delays between the leading and second images of the lensed system, with statistical uncertainties of 0.01 days (15 minutes).\n",4,

However, observations have shown that we only see dozens of dwarf galaxies and not the hundreds to thousands that are predicted. This means that either the CDM model prediction is wrong, or most of the substructure consists of dark matter that cannot be observed directly. Massive galaxies serve as natural gravitational lenses throughout the universe that allow us to indirectly observe these dark matter perturbations. Strong gravitational lensing occurs when these massive elliptical galaxies have the critical density required to bend light from a source located behind it and produce multiple images of that same source. Dark matter clumps located near these multiple images affect their positions and flux ratios. We used lensing simulations to quantify how dark matter clumps affect image properties and to characterize this zone of influence through color maps of chi-squared values. Our results showed regions around each of the image positions that display significant perturbations for low mass clumps. For higher mass clumps, however, these distinct regions bleed together. We found that there is a correlation between the mass of the dark matter clump and the area it perturbs.This research has been supported by NSF grant PHY-1263280.\n",7,

Images are generated at arbitrary observer angle relative to the black hole spin axis by implementing spatial and temporal interpolation of conserved magnetohydrodynamic flow quantities from a time series of output datablocks from fully general relativistic 3D simulations. We also describe the evolution of simulations of JAB systems' dynamical and kinematic variables, e.g., velocity shear and momentum density, respectively, and the variation of these variables with respect to observer polar and azimuthal angles. We produce, at frequencies from radio to optical, fixed observer time intensity and polarization maps using various plasma physics motivated prescriptions for the emissivity function of physical quantities from the simulation output, and analyze the corresponding light curves. Our hypothesis is that this approach reproduces observed features of JAB systems such as superluminal bulk flow projections and quasi-periodic oscillations in the light curves more closely than extant stylized analytical models, e.g., cannonball bulk flows. Moreover, our development of user-friendly, versatile C++ routines for processing images of state-of-the-art simulations of JAB systems may afford greater flexibility for observing a wide range of sources from high power BL-Lacs to low power quasars (possibly with the same simulation) without requiring years of observation using multiple telescopes. Advantages of observing simulations instead of observing astrophysical sources directly include: the absence of a diffraction limit, panoramic views of the same object and the ability to freely track features.

Many models for spacetime foam are defined by the accumulation power α, which parameterizes the rate at which Planck-scale spatial uncertainties (and the phase shifts they produce) may accumulate over large path-lengths. Here α is defined by the expression for the path-length fluctuations, δl, of a source at distance l, where δl≈l<sup>1-α </sup>l<sub>P</sub>, with l<sub>P</sub> being the Planck length. We reassess previous proposals to use astronomical observations of distant quasars and AGN to test models of spacetime foam. We show explicitly how wavefront distortions on small scales cause the image intensity to decay to the point where distant objects become undetectable when the path-length fluctuations become comparable to the wavelength of the radiation. Chandra X-ray observations set a constraint α> 0.58, which rules out the random walk model (with α=1/2). Much firmer constraints can be set with Fermi detections of quasars at GeV energies, and at TeV energies with ground-based Cherenkov telescopes: α>0.67 and α>0.72, respectively.

Indirect evidence for the existence of GWs has been obtained through radio pulsar studies in BNS systems. A study of BBHs and other compact objects has limitations in the electromagnetic spectrum, therefore direct detections of GWs will open a new window into their nature. The effort targeting direct GWs detection is anchored on the development of a detector known as Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observation). Although detecting GW sources represents an anticipated breakthrough in physics, making GW astrophysics a reality critically relies on our ability to determine and measure the physical parameters associated with GW sources. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations on high-performance computing clusters for parameter estimation on high dimensional spaces (GW sources - 15 parameters). The quality of GW parameter estimation greatly depends on having the best possible knowledge of the expected waveform. Unfortunately, BBH GW production is very complex and our best waveforms are not valid across the full parameter space.

Wake*,D. Wake*,Sessioned,University of Wisconsin-Madison; The Open University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The 6-year SDSS-IV MaNGA survey will measure spatially resolved spectroscopy for 10,000 nearby galaxies using the Sloan 2.5m telescope and the BOSS spectrographs with a new fiber arrangement consisting of 17 individually deployable IFUs. We present the simultaneous design of the target selection and IFU size distribution to optimally meet our targeting requirements. The requirements for the main samples were to use simple cuts in redshift and magnitude to produce an approximately flat number density of targets as a function of stellar mass, ranging from 1x10<sup>9</sup> to 1x10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, and radial coverage to either 1.5 (Primary sample) or 2.5 (Secondary sample) effective radii, while maximizing S/N and spatial resolution. In addition we constructed a “Color-Enhanced” sample where we required 25% of the targets to have an approximately flat number density in the color and mass plane. We show how these requirements are met using simple absolute magnitude (and color) dependent redshift cuts applied to an extended version of the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA), how this determines the distribution of IFU sizes and the resulting properties of the MaNGA sample.\n",1,

Westfall*,K. Westfall*; A. S. Laws,Sessioned,University of Portsmouth; University of Southampton,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Using data from the first year of the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey, we present a preliminary study of the amplitude of non-circular motions in a sample of disk galaxies. We select galaxies that have either a visual classification as a spiral galaxy by the Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al. 2011) and/or a measured Sersic index of less than 2.5 from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (nsatlas.org). We also remove high-inclination systems by selecting galaxies with isophotal ellipticity measurements of less than 0.6, implying an inclination of less than 65 degrees. For each galaxy, we fit a tilted-disk model to the observed line-of-sight velocities (Andersen & Bershady 2013). The geometric projection of the circularly rotating disk is simultaneously fit to both the ionized-gas (H-alpha) and stellar kinematics, whereas the rotation curves of the two dynamical tracers are allowed to be independent. We deproject the residuals of the velocity-field fit to the disk-plane polar coordinates and select a radial region that is fully covered in aziumuth, yet not undersampled by the on-sky spaxel. Similar to the approach taken by Bovy et al. (2015) for the Milky Way, we then compute the two-dimensional power spectrum of this velocity-residual map, which provides the amplitude of non-circular motions at all modes probed by the data. Our preliminary analysis reveals disk-plane non-circular motions in both the stars and ionized-gas with typical peak amplitudes of approximately 20 km/s. Additionally, our initial findings appear to demonstrate that non-circular motions in barred galaxies are stronger in the ionized gas than in the stars, a trend not seen in unbarred galaxies.\n",2,

J. Hubbard*,R. J. Hubbard*; A. M. Diamond-Stanic,Sessioned,Howard University; University of Wisconsin-Madison,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The efficiency with which galaxies convert gas into stars is driven by the continuous cycle of accretion and feedback processes within the circumgalactic medium. Extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) can provide insights into the tumultuous processes that govern the evolution of galactic disks because eDIG emission traces both inflowing and outflowing gas. With the help of state-of-the-art, spatially-resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), we developed a computational method to identify eDIG based on the strength of and spatial extent of optical emission lines for a diverse sample of 550 nearby galaxies. This sample includes roughly half of the MaNGA galaxies that will become publicly available in summer 2016 as part of the Thirteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We identified signatures of eDIG in 8% of the galaxies in this sample, and we found that these signatures are particularly common among galaxies with active star formation and inclination angles >45 degrees. Our analysis of the morphology, incidence, and kinematics of eDIG has important implications for current models of accretion and feedback processes that regulate star formation in galaxies.

Zhang*,K. Zhang*; R. Yan,Sessioned,University of Kentucky,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) is prevalent in star-forming galaxies. Using a sample of galaxies observed by MaNGA, we demonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impact the measurements of emission line ratios, hence the gas-phase metallicity measurements and the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams. We demonstrate that emission line surface brightness (SB) is a reasonably good proxy to separate HII regions from regions dominated by diffuse ionized gas. For spatially-adjacent regions or regions at the same radius, many line ratios change systematically with emission line surface brightness, reflecting a gradual increase of dominance by DIG towards low SB. DIG could significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity gradient. Because DIG tend to have a higher temperature than HII regions, at fixed metallicity DIG displays lower [NII]/[OII] ratios. DIG also show lower [OIII]/[OII] ratios than HII regions, due to extended partially-ionized regions that enhance all low-ionization lines ([NII], [SII], [OII], [OI]). The contamination by DIG is responsible for a substantial portion of the scatter in metallicity measurements. At different surface brightness, line ratios and line ratio gradients can differ systematically. As DIG fraction could change with radius, it can affect the metallicity gradient measurements in systematic ways. The three commonly used strong-line metallicity indicators, R23, [NII]/[OII], O3N2, are all affected in different ways. To make robust metallicity gradient measurements, one has to properly isolate HII regions and correct for DIG contamination. In line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves HII regions towards composite or LINER-like regions.\n",4,

Fuller*,L. Fuller*; E. Lopez-Rodriguez; C. C. Packham,Sessioned,University of Texas at San Antonio,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) requires a toroidal region of optically and geometrically thick dust obscuring a central engine, accounting for various observed spectral features. Our aim is to investigate the overall torus properties to obtain analytical results for its physical parameters. We present 31.5um photometric observations of 12 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the 2.5m SOFIA telescope using the FORCAST camera. We used Clumpy torus models and a Bayesian approach to fit the IR (1.2-31.5um) nuclear SEDs and high angular resolution mid-IR (8-13um) spectroscopy. We found that the turnover of the torus emission does not occur at wavelengths <31.5um, which we interpret as a lower-limit for the peak torus emission. Including the 31.5um nuclear flux 1) reduces the dispersion of Clumpy torus models at wavelengths >30um, which better constrains the model parameters, 2) generally decreases the radial extent of the torus. We find torus radii ranging from ~1 - 8.5pc, with an average radius of 2.6pc, which is consistent with interferometric and high-spatial resolution observations.\n",1,

M. De Buizer*,J. M. De Buizer*,Sessioned,SOFIA/USRA,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We know very little about clustered star formation in comparison to isolated star formation, even though it is believed that most stars form in OB clusters. Giant HII (GHII) regions host the most active areas of OB star formation in the galaxy, and as such are great laboratories for the study of the earliest stages of clustered star formation. An understanding of the link between the large unresolved star forming regions which dominate in external galaxies, require the results from a holistic study like this one of similar regions in our own Galaxy to calibrate their properties. This study uses SOFIA's FORCAST instrument to collect 19.7 um and 37.1 um maps of all 56 GHII regions in the Milky Way, and 8 targets have been observed so far. The 37um maps have the best-ever achieved resolution at that wavelength. The combination of longer wavelength IR data and good spatial resolution allow the detection and characterization of embedded young stellar objects and the colder dust population throughout the GHII regions. These data are being combined with Spitzer/IRAC, Herschel 70 um, and radio (2-6 cm) data already collected for these targets to determine the physical properties of the dust, including dust mass, temperature, and optical depth, derived across the GHII regions.\n",2,

One hypothesis to resolve this discrepancy is that two kinds of regions with distinct properties are responsible for the abundance measurements from ORLs and CELs. Lines from [OIV], [SIII], [SIV] and [ArIII] are detected in the FORCAST spectra, which cover the wavelength ranges 8.7--13.9 and 17.7--27.6 microns with moderate spectral resolution (R~100).

L. Huard*,T. L. Huard*; S. Terebey,Sessioned,Univ. of Maryland; Cal. State Univ. at Los Angeles,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): During the last decade, the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Telescope enabled large infrared surveys of nearby molecular clouds forming low mass stars.  The 70 micron observations obtained by those facilities provide estimates of the internal luminosities of protostars that are reliable to within a factor of 2, in general.  Spitzer observations at shorter wavelengths yield estimates that are much less constrained, reliable only to within an order of magnitude, at best.  With the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) routinely operating science flights, this facility may be used to further study protostellar populations.  We demonstrate that mid-infrared images obtained with the Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) achieve internal luminosities with reliability comparable to that achieved by 70 micron observations.  With its dynamic range and greater angular resolution, FORCAST may be used to characterize protostars that were either saturated or merged with other sources in previous surveys.\n",4,

For this project, we use Hubble Space Telescope photometric data in 4-5 visible and near-UV filters to measure the young stellar clusters in nine early-type galaxies. Aperture photometry colors were compared to colors from synthetic photometry produced by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code (Conroy et. al, ApJ <b>699</b>, 486-506 (2009)), using a chi-squared likelihood method to estimate the age, metallicity and extinction for each cluster. Masses were determined using the best-fit model, the distance to each galaxy and the measured fluxes. Young clusters were selected below a cutoff age of 100 Myr, and star formation rates for each galaxy were then calculated as the combined mass of the young clusters divided by the cutoff age. Star formation rates computed in this way are far below those computed using the 22 micron emission. While some completeness effects are biasing the cluster-estimated SFRs low, the extreme difference (two orders of magnitude) may also point to SFR overestimation due to contamination from older stars in the 22 micron SFRs.\n",3,

Comparing the spectral energy distribution of the entire galaxy with that of the circumnuclear ring indicates how starburst activity influences the galactic spectral energy distribution.\n",5,

These regions are within 1-4 kpc from our solar system.  The narrowband flux in Brackett gamma was used as a star-formation tracer to calculate a star-formation rate for each region.  This is compared with other star-formation rates found using other methods such as the count of young stars and YSOs, and rates calculated from using other tracers (e.g. 70 micron monochromatic luminosity). The molecular hydrogen narrowband images were manually searched to locate outflows from young stars.  Once these outflows are identified, it may help to get a better survey of the young stellar population.  A better understanding of the stellar population distribution can lead to more accurate star-formation rates to compare to those calculated from star-formation tracers. We found the regions NGC 6334 and G3266 to have the highest levels of ongoing star formation activity as indicated by the number of molecular hydrogen objects (MHOs) detected. There are a total of 279 cataloged MHOs in 181 categorized systems for the six regions.

The spatial distribution and Class of the young stellar population (YSOs) is available for these regions from the Spitzer c2d and Gould Belt surveys, with added sources from the Herschel 70 micron images. Together, these datasets allow us to compare, for the first time at similar spatial resolutions, the distributions of the dense gas and YSOs over regions containing up to 90 identified YSOs. This enables a detailed look at the separation between YSOs and the nearest dense gas peak and a measure of overall relationship between the YSO and dense gas distributions. We find that most Class 0 YSOs are forming in the highest column density regions: leaves in the dendrogram analysis utilized by CLASSy. In Serpens and Perseus, we find that 29% and 38%, respectively, of the leaves have identified embedded YSOs. Class 1 sources are less confined to leaf locations; Class II sources are distributed throughout regions, mostly away from hierarchical peaks. This trend could be due to a modest (0.1 km/sec) velocity difference between YSOs and their natal cores, or due to the YSOs consuming or dispersing their natal cores.\n",8,

Romita*,K. Romita*; E. A. Lada; M. Cioni,Sessioned,University of Florida; University of Potsdam,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the Milky Way, the majority of stars form in embedded clusters (Lada & Lada 2003), which makes them a fundamental unit of star formation. Despite their importance, our knowledge of cluster formation remains primitive. For example, we don't have a clear idea of how varying physical environments affects the cluster formation process. In order to address this, we have begun a comprehensive, systematic search for embedded stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using near-infrared data from the VISTA Magellanic Clouds Survey (Cioni et al. 2011). To date, we have searched 46% of the molecular clouds in the MAGMA CO Survey (Wong et al. 2011). We have identified 125 embedded cluster candidates. This is approximately double the number of embedded clusters that have been identified within ~2.5 kpc of the Sun (Lada & Lada 2003). We have determined sizes, luminosities, and masses for these embedded clusters and calculated the star formation rates (SFRs) of the LMC molecular clouds containing clusters, and finally compared the LMC and Milky Way embedded cluster properties and SFRs. Our preliminary results indicate the LMC embedded clusters are larger, more luminous and more massive than the embedded clusters in the local Milky Way. However, even though the overall cluster properties differ in these two environments, the SFRs of the molecular clouds in both environments are consistent with the SFR scaling law from Lada et al. (2012). This consistency may indicate that while the details of embedded cluster formation may vary between environments, the overall star formation process within molecular clouds may be universal.\n",11,

Malinen*,J. Malinen*,Sessioned,Florida State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The nearby high-latitude cloud L1642 is one of only two known very high latitude (|b| > 30 deg) clouds actively forming stars. This cloud is a rare example of star formation in isolated conditions, and can reveal important details of star formation in general, e.g., of the effect of magnetic fields. We compare Herschel dust emission structures and magnetic field orientation revealed by Planck polarization maps in L1642, and also combine these with dynamic information from molecular line observations. The high-resolution Herschel data reveal a complex structure including a dense, compressed central blob with elongated extensions, low density striations, ""fishbone"" like structures with a spine and perpendicular striations, and a spiraling ""tail"". The Planck polarization data reveal an ordered magnetic field that pervades the cloud and is aligned with the surrounding low density striations. We show that there is a complex interplay between the cloud structure and large scale magnetic fields revealed by Planck polarization data at 10' resolution. This suggests that the magnetic field is closely linked to the formation and evolution of the cloud. We see a clear transition from aligned to perpendicular structures approximately at a column density of NH = 2x10^21 cm-2. We conclude that Planck polarization data revealing the large scale magnetic field orientation can be very useful even when comparing to the finest structures in higher resolution data, e.g. Herschel at ~18"" resolution.\n",12,

This applies in star-forming clouds where self-gravity is negligible near protostars and new-born stars, but instead of being uniform the gas is supersonically turbulent and threaded by dynamically important (Alven Mach number $\sim 1$) large-scale magnetic fields. To determine the Bondi-like accretion rate in these environments, we used the ORION2 code to carry out grid-based 3D adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion onto sink particles embedded in an environment of fully developed, magnetized supersonic isothermal turbulence. We evolved the models until the median and mean accretion rates, over particles, became steady. We present a simple semi-analytic model that predicts the median and mean accretion rate from the turbulent properties of the background medium, such as the 3D Mach number and RMS plasma-β, and show that it is highly consistent with our simulations. Numerical codes can use our semi-analytic model as an accurate sub-grid model for accretion in magnetized supersonic isothermal turbulence.\n",13,

We further confirm the ability of the spectral typing method to accurately differentiate between early- and late-types stars to K′ = 15.5 mag, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method at magnitudes to K′ = 16.0 mag. We examine the luminosity function using these dim, 16 mag stars and establish that their luminosity function indicates a mass function which is less top-heavy than previously derived, but which is still not in agreement with the Salpeter model. Our conclusions call for further observational evidence for lower mass stars, beyond 16.0 mag.\n",1,

Meier,Sessioned,Northwestern University; National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO); New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The inner 400 pc of our Galaxy, or the so-called the central molecular zone (CMZ), has a unique environment with a large mass of dense, warm molecular gas. One of the premier questions is how star formation (SF) differs in this unique environment from elsewhere in the Galaxy. We intend to address this issue by identifying improved numbers and locations of early sites of SF. We have conducted high resolution surveys of the CMZ, looking for early SF indicators such as 22 GHz water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers. We present the initial water maser results from the SWAG survey and methanol results from the first full VLA survey of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the CMZ. These surveys span beyond the inner 1.2<sup>ο</sup> x 0.5<sup>ο</sup> of the Galaxy, including Sgr B through Sgr C. The improved spatial and spectral resolutions (~26"" and 2 km s<sup>-1</sup>) and sensitivity (RMS ~10 mJy beam<sup>-1</sup>) of our ATCA observations have allowed us to identify over 140 water maser candidates in the SWAG survey. This is a factor of 3 more than detected from prior surveys of the CMZ. The preliminary distribution of these candidates appears to be uniform along Galactic longitude. Should this distribution persist for water masers associated with star formation (as opposed to those produced by evolved stars), then this result would imply a more uniform distribution of recent SF activity in the CMZ. Prior works have shown that 2/3 of the molecular gas mass is located at positive Galactic longitudes, and young stellar objects (YSOs) identified by IR SEDs are located predominantly at negative Galactic longitudes. A combination of these results can provide insight on the evolution of SF within the CMZ. We are currently comparing the water maser positions to other catalogs (ex. OH/IR stars) in order to distinguish between the mechanisms producing these masers. We are also currently working on determining the distribution of 6.7 GHz methanol masers. These masers do not contain the same ambiguity as water masers as to their source and are only produced by high mass star formation. Finally we have also conducted the first on-the-fly (OTF)  VLA survey of 22 GHz water masers spanning the inner 2.0<sup>ο</sup> x 0.5<sup>ο</sup>, with 0.3"" and 0.4 km s<sup>-1</sup> spatial and spectral resolutions.\n",2,

However, the extinction from the intervening gas and dust is extremely high (A_V~30), and cloaks these objects from view in visible wavelengths. Near-infrared wavelengths are less susceptible to extinction from gas and dust by factors of several magnitudes, but still suffer from differential reddening at very small scales; eg, 5 arcseconds (Gosling et al MNRAS 2009). <i> </i>De-reddening the GC furthers broadband imaging surveys of all types, such X-ray binary IR counterpart or transient searches being carried out by CIRCE on the GTC. Furthermore<i>, </i>MIRADAS, with its multiplexing capability and high resolution, will take advantage of these extinction maps as well to probe the chemo-dynamics and structure of the inner Milky Way when it goes on-sky in 2018/2019.\n",10,

Arendt,Sessioned,"University of Maryland, College Park; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The center of our Milky Way Galaxy, better known as the Galactic Center, is host to many important and influential landmarks, including the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, stellar complexes like Sgr B, and many young ultraviolet light producing stars. The stellar radiated output produced by these stars is absorbed by the dust and gas present in the ambient medium around these stars. This radiation produced by stars gives rise to ionized H II regions, which then emit through bremsstrahlung emission (free-free emission). Bremsstrahlung emission occurs when electrons scatter off ions without being captured, so they are free before and after interaction. Another emission component seen in the Galactic Center is synchrotron emission, which is produced by energetic electrons generated from the jet of the supermassive black hole and supernova remnants, spiraling around magnetic field lines. Any object that is hot gives off light, or thermal emission. When the ultraviolet radiation from stars is absorbed by the dust, the dust is heated, and then re-radiates as thermal emission at far-infrared wavelengths. Using the three previous emission components, this environment was analyzed in order to identify three main features in the Galactic Center: ionized gas, magnetic fields and dust. Bremsstrahlung emission was used to trace H II regions (ionized gas), synchrotron emission was used to trace magnetic field lines, and thermal emission was used to trace the dust. After tracing these spectral features, they were displayed, resulting in a map of the Galactic Center showing all three of these features that can be used for further analysis in the near future.\n",11,

Debattista,Sessioned,University of Michigan; Shanghai Astronomical Observatory; University of Central Lancashire,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Observations of external disk galaxies with bars frequently show boxy or peanut shaped bulges, which have a distinct X-shaped structure when the system is viewed edge-on. Such features are also well documented in N-body simulations, where they arise from the buckling of the bar. The precise nature of the orbits that create this structure is still uncertain. Some studies argue that the bulge/X-shape structure is formed and supported by resonant 2:1 “banana” orbit family, while other argue that they arise from 5:3 “brezel” orbits. Here we examine a set of N-body models of a barred disk galaxy (with and without a central black hole). We generate 2-D maps of projected kinematics both for specific orbit families as well as the full simulation of the bars at different orientations. By examining the line-of-sight velocities, velocity dispersions and 3rd and 4th Gauss-Hermite polynomials we attempt to deduce the type of orbits most likely to produce the X-shaped features. We also generate mock kinematics for the Milky Way bar and predict the kinematical features associated with the X-shape that will be observed with upcoming stellar surveys.\n",12,

Wenger,Sessioned,Cal State University LA; NRAO; UVA,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): HII regions are sites of recent star formation where massive stars have ionized the surrounding gas. They are bright at radio wavelengths and can be detected throughout the Galactic disk. The Green Bank Telescope (GBT) HII Region Discovery Survey (HRDS) doubled the number of known HII regions in the first Galactic quadrant using radio recombination line (RRL) and free-free radio continuum emission at 8-10 GHz. The physical (electron) temperature, a proxy for metallicity, is derived from the line-to-continuum ratio. The metallicity is the abundance of metals, elements heavier than helium, and their distribution in the Milky Way provides information about Galactic evolution. These metallicities correspond to present day values because HII regions are relatively young (< 10 Myr). Here we discuss Very Large Array (VLA) RRL and continuum observations of 21, distant HRDS HII regions. The VLA provides a more sensitive and accurate measure of the radio continuum and therefore better determination of the metallicity. The data were reduced both manually and via a pipeline using CASA.

They can be divided into several sub-classes, depending on the nature and degree of the observed enhancements of their neutron-capture elements, providing information on their likely progenitors. CEMP-s stars (which exhibit enhanced s-process elements) are thought to be enhanced by mass transfer from an evolved AGB companion, while CEMP-no stars (which exhibit no over-abundances of neutron-capture elements) appear to be associated with explosions of the very first generations of stars. High-resolution spectroscopic analyses are generally required in order to make these sub-classifications.<br /><br />Several recent studies have suggested the existence of bimodality in the distribution of absolute carbon abundances among CEMP stars -- most CEMP-no stars belong to a low-C band ((A(C) \sim 6.5$), while most CEMP-s stars reside on a high-C band (A(C) $\sim 8.25$). The number of CEMP stars considered by individual studies is, however, quite small, so we have compiled all available high-resolution spectroscopic data for CEMP stars, in order to further investigate the existence of the claimed carbon bi-modality, and to consider what can be learned about the progenitors of CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars based on the observed distribution of A(C) on the individual plateaus.<br /><br />We acknowledge partial support from the grant PHY 14-30152; Physics Frontier Center/JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE), awarded by the US National Science Foundation.\n",16,

In previous work, statistical photometric parallax was used to trace the Sagittarius Dwarf tidal stream, the so-called bifurcated piece of the Sagittaritus stream, and the Virgo Overdensity through the Milky Way.  We use an improved knowledge of this distribution in a new algorithm that accounts for the changes in the stellar population of color-selected stars near the photometric limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  Although we select bluer main sequence turnoff stars (MSTO) as tracers, large color errors near the survey limit cause many stars to be scattered out of our selection box and many fainter, redder stars to be scattered into our selection box.  We show that we are able to recover parameters for analogues of these streams in simulated data using a maximum likelihood optimization on MilkyWay@home.

In order to constrain whether asymmetric HI profiles arise from tidal interactions, gas accretion, or other possible phenomena, we examine the frequency of strong HI profile asymmetries as a function of environment parameterized by nearest neighbor distance, group halo mass, and location within large-scale structure. We find no link between the rate of highly asymmetric HI profiles and local or global environment, and we compare this result to expectations from simple models of galaxy interactions. We do see an increase in strong HI asymmetries with decreasing halo mass, however it does not exceed the increase expected from decreasing signal-to-noise of the HI observations. These results are tentatively consistent with a picture of isotropic cooling rather than directed cold streams within halos down to masses of 10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>. However, we argue that two built-in biases affect HI asymmetry measurements. First, the profile asymmetry can be systematically underestimated when using the systemic velocity from the HI profile itself, which particularly affects low-mass galaxies. Second, the profile asymmetry may be overestimated due to confusion from companions below the magnitude limit of the survey. We explore the possibility that analysis of HI profiles with reference to optical rotation curves may mitigate these biases.

Volume-limited analysis of RESOLVE’s complete census of HI-to-stellar mass ratios and star formation histories for ~1500 galaxies points to the necessity of an “open box” model of galaxy fueling, with the most gas-dominated galaxies doubling their stellar masses on ~Gyr timescales in a regime of rapid accretion. Transitions in gas richness and disk-building activity for isolated or central galaxies with halo masses near ~10^11.5 Msun and ~10^12 Msun plausibly correspond to the endpoints of a theoretically predicted transition in halo gas temperature that slows accretion across this range. The same mass range is associated with the initial grouping of isolated galaxies into common halos, where “isolated” is defined relative to the survey baryonic mass limits of >~10^9 Msun. Above 10^11.5 Msun, patterns in central vs. satellite gas richness as a function of group halo mass suggest that galaxy refueling is valved off from the inside out as the halo grows, with total quenching beyond the virial radius for halo masses >~10^13-13.5 Msun. Within the transition range from ~10^11.5-10^12 Msun, theoretical models predict >3 dex dispersion in ratios of uncooled halo gas to cold gas in galaxies (or more generally gas and stars). In RESOLVE and ECO, the baryonic mass function of galaxies in this transitional halo mass range displays signs of stripping or destruction of satellites, leading us to investigate a possible connection with halo gas heating using central galaxy color and group dynamics to probe group evolutionary state. Finally, we take a first look at how internal variations in metallicity, dynamics, and star formation constrain accretion mechanisms such as cold streams, induced extraplanar gas cooling, isotropic halo gas cooling, and gas-rich merging in different mass and environment regimes.

Using pPXF, we have measured the stellar velocity dispersions (sigma values) from high resolution 485 - 550 nm spectroscopy for ~15% of the blue E/S0 sample.

Preliminary results from cross-checking known AGN catalogs with the blue E/S0 sample have revealed nuclear activity in ~20 of these galaxies based on heterogeneous criteria (BPT line ratio analysis, spectral line broadening, etc.), some of which may not entirely distinguish starburst from AGN activity.

Sinha,Sessioned,Rutgers University; University of North Carolina; Vanderbilt University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Observations of compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) have uncovered abnormally high velocity dispersions and surface brightnesses for objects of their mass. These properties indicate that they may be the tidally stripped remnants of larger disk galaxies. We test this tidal stripping scenario using N-body simulations of cE formation with the Gadget-2 code. We track the velocity dispersions of stellar particles within the half-light radius throughout our simulations, which allows us to compare our simulated galaxies with velocity dispersion data for cEs in the RESOLVE survey. We first consider initial conditions similar to published work, which report stripping of a large spiral galaxy (stellar mass ~ 10^11 solar masses) to cE size in a cluster potential. We find that the density of the disk galaxy is too high to allow it to lose particles to the less dense cluster. We argue that the initial position of the galaxy with respect to the cluster as well as the large size of the cluster particles in comparison to the size of the galaxy particles artificially heightened the stripping percentages reported in previous work. We hypothesize that only a dwarf galaxy with a shallower density profile can be stripped to cE size, and we present initial efforts to test this idea. We simulate a dwarf galaxy based on a real system in the RESOLVE survey, with stellar mass 10^9 solar masses and half-light radius 1.15 kpc. Within ~700 pc our dwarf is denser than our cluster, suggesting the stripped remnant should be close to the size of RESOLVE cEs. This radius contains approximately 13% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy, or ~2 x 10^8 solar masses. We therefore expect our stripped remnant to be at least this massive, although the impact parameter of the orbit will determine how much mass is actually removed. We discuss the position of our simulated galaxies compared to RESOLVE cEs in the velocity dispersion vs. mass plane.

""Pair halos,"" the visible consequences of these electromagnetic cascades, are faint and difficult to observe against their AGN counterparts. We investigate three methods for indirectly identifying pair halos, using a two-component approach to model the AGN core/halo image. We estimate each method’s sensitivity by utilizing a new, detailed Monte Carlo pair-halo simulation.\n",1,

A quasi-periodicity in the gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV and E>1 GeV) is observed from the well-known GeV/TeV BL Lac object PG 1553+113 (Ackermann et al. submitted). The significance of the 2.18 +/- 0.08 year-period gamma-ray modulation, seen in 3.5 oscillation maxima observed, is supported by significant cross-correlated variations observed in radio and optical flux light curves, through data collected in the OVRO, Tuorla, KAIT, and CSS monitoring programs and Swift UVOT. The optical cycle, appearing in about 10 years of data, has a similar period, while the radio-band oscillation observed at 15 GHz is less regular and coherent. The available X-ray flux data obtained by Swift XRT appears also to be linearly correlated with the gamma-ray flux. Further long-term multi-wavelength monitoring of this blazar may discriminate among the possible explanations for this first evidence of periodicity.\n",2,

With an array of four 12-m telescopes, VERITAS detects the Cherenkov light emitted from air showers initiated by astrophysical gamma rays. A sequence of upgrades completed in 2012 aimed at lowering the energy threshold resulted in the instrument being sensitive to gamma rays between 85 GeV and 30 TeV.  Fully operational since 2007, VERITAS has so far detected 54 VHE gamma-ray objects in eight different source classes.  The active galactic nuclei (AGN) class comprises the majority of these detections, with 34 sources that include several radio galaxies but are predominantly blazars (AGN with relativistic jets pointing towards Earth). The scientific importance of VHE detections of AGN includes studying the details of emission mechanisms in blazars and elucidating whether they are sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and astrophysical neutrinos. Additionally VHE gamma-ray observations can be used to gain cosmological insights such as placing limits on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) and the extragalactic background light (EBL), which comprises all the diffuse starlight in the universe.

Johnson*,C. Johnson*,Sessioned,"University of California, Santa Cruz","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Gamma-ray quasars provide insights on the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei, and can constrain the diffuse radiation fields that fill the Universe. Detecting significant emission above 100 GeV from a distant quasar shows that some of the radiated gamma rays are not affected by pair-production interactions with low-energy photons such as the radiation near the supermassive black hole lying at the jet’s base, or the extragalactic background light (EBL). During April 2015, VERITAS detected gamma-ray emission up to ~200 GeV from PKS 1441+25 (z = 0.939); this was a period of high activity across all wavelengths. Before PKS 1441+25, only four confirmed gamma-ray emitting quasars had been detected at very high energies, three of them much less distant. Utilizing the recent release of Pass-8 Fermi-LAT data, we observe an integrated flux (100 MeV – 100 GeV) one to two orders of magnitude larger than the value reported in the 3FGL catalog and a slight preference for curvature in the spectrum during the contemporaneous VERITAS observations. These gamma-ray observations of PKS 1441+25 suggest that the emitting region is located thousands of Schwarzschild radii away from the black hole. The gamma-ray detection also sets a strict upper limit on the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared EBL intensity. This suggests that galaxy surveys have resolved most, if not all, of the sources contributing to the EBL at these wavelengths.\n",7,

The previously proposed sources of acceleration for these UHECRs were gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their energetic activity and powerful jets. However, a problem arises between the acceleration method and the observed CR spectrum. The CRs from GRBs or AGN jets  are assumed to undergo Fermi acceleration and a source injection spectrum proportional to E^-2 is expected. However, the most recent fits to the spectrum and nuclear composition  suggest an injection spectrum proportional to E^-1. It is well known that such a hard spectrum is characteristic of unipolar induction of rotating compact objects. When this method is applied to the AGN cores, they prove to be much too luminous to accelerate CR nuclei without photodisintegrating, thus creating significant energy losses. Instead, here we re-examine the possibility of these particles being accelerated around the much less luminous quasar remnants, or dead quasars. We compare the interaction times of curvature radiation and photodisintegration, the two primary energy loss considerations with the acceleration time scale. We show that the energy losses at the source are not significant enough as to prevent these CRs from reaching the maximum observed energies. Using data from observatories in the northern and southern sky, the Telescope Array and the Pierre Auger Observatory respectively, two hotspots have been discerned which have some associated quasar remnants that help to motivate our study.\n",9,

Kraus,Sessioned,University of Texas Austin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Recent discoveries of planets orbiting retired A-stars on close orbits and young A-stars on very wide orbits have renewed interest in the properties of nearby intermediate-mass stars. Especially interesting are the young stars because directly-imaged planets orbiting them may be bright enough for characterization (e.g. HR 8799, Beta Pictoris, etc). However, intermediate-mass stars and especially young intermediate mass stars are part of multiple systems more often than not. Close stellar companions may affect the formation and orbital evolution of any planets, and the properties of the companions can help constrain the binary formation mechanism. The mass ratio distribution of a population of binary stars, especially if the distribution for close companions is significantly different from that of wide companions, is helpful to distinguish companions that were born in or affected by the circumstellar disk from those which formed through fragmentation of the molecular core. Previous imaging surveys have found that binary systems with A-type primary stars tend to have cool companions with extreme mass ratios. There are hints at a much flatter mass ratio distribution for close companions, but strong completeness effects complicate the picture. We have conducted a spectroscopic survey of ~400 nearby main sequence A- and B-type stars, aimed at detecting stellar companions as late as M4 for all orbital separations <100 AU. We have searched for companions to the stars by cross-correlating the spectra against model templates for F-M type stars; a significant peak in the cross-correlation function indicates a detection. Our cross-correlation technique can detect low-mass companions with orbits that are too wide to detect with radial velocity monitoring and too small to detect with imaging techniques, making it complementary to work already done. We will present results from our survey and compare the mass ratio distribution we measure to the corresponding distribution for wide companions.\n",3,

It is because halos of the same mass in different environments have different assembly histories and cluster differently. There have been several studies showing such environmental effects on the linear bias of halos. The halo bias on small scales, however, is scale-dependent. I will present the first study of the scale-dependence of halo assembly bias using the depth of the gravitational potential well, Vmax, as our secondary halo property. We find that assembly bias in low-mass halos exhibits a pronounced scale-dependent ""bump"" at 500 kpc/h - 5 Mpc/h. This feature weakens and eventually vanishes for halos of higher mass. We show that this scale-dependent signature can primarily be attributed to a special subpopulation of ejected halos, defined as present-day host halos that were previously members of a higher-mass halo at some point in their past history. A corollary of our results is that galaxy clustering on scales of r~1-2 Mpc/h can be impacted by up to ~15% by the choice of the halo property used in the halo model, even for stellar mass-limited samples.\n",2,

Bunn,Sessioned,University of Richmond,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We describe a method for forecasting errors in interferometric measurements of polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, based on the use of the Fisher matrix calculated from the visibility covariance and relation matrices. In addition to noise and sample variance, the method can account for many kinds of systematic error by calculating an augmented Fisher matrix, including parameters that characterize the instrument along with the cosmological parameters to be estimated. The method is illustrated with examples of gain errors and errors in polarizer orientation. The augmented Fisher matrix approach is applicable to a much wider range of problems beyond CMB interferometry.\n",3,

The analysis confirms what has been reported previously, that sources of high-frequency continuum radiation exist in the galactic interstellar medium that produce structure that has been incorrectly interpreted as being cosmological in origin.  The mechanism appears to be free-free emission from electron concentrations in regions where the dust and HI are similarly clumped or otherwise enhanced due to geometric effects.  By comparing model calculations with the data it is concluded that the source of the radiation is relatively close to the sun, or order 25 to 50 pc distant.  The required ionization fraction relative to HI is of order 0.05 – 0.08 for the areas tested.\n",4,

Of particular interest is the evidence for large-scale power modulation: the variance in one half of the sky is larger than the other half. Either this variation is a mere fluke, or it requires a major revision of the standard cosmological paradigm. <br /><br />The way to determine which is the case is to make predictions for future data sets, based on the hypothesis that the anomaly is meaningful and on the hypothesis that it is a fluke. We make predictions for the CMB polarization anisotropy based on a cosmological model in which statistical isotropy is broken via coupling with a dipolar modulation field. Our predictions are constrained to match the observed Planck temperature variations. We identify the modes in CMB polarization data that most strongly distinguish between the modulation and no-modulation hypotheses.\n",6,

Several groups have reported excess emission in gamma rays peaking around 3 GeV relative to expectations from conventional models for the interstellar emission. We study the uncertainty of the excess emission in Pass 8 Fermi-LAT data due to modeling of the various emission components in that direction. In particular, we quantify the uncertainties on the excess by refitting with several GALPROP models of Galactic diffuse emission, an alternative distribution of gas along the line of sight based on starlight extinction data, a model of the Fermi bubbles at low latitudes, and including templates for additional sources of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons near the GC.  In all models that we have tested the excess emission remains significant. The most important contributions to the uncertainties are modeling of the Fermi bubbles and including templates for additional sources of CR electrons. We also consider several models for the population and emission of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the inner Galaxy. Although the MSP contribution has large uncertainties, MSPs can explain the GC excess under plausible assumptions.\n",7,

Rogers*,L. Rogers*,Sessioned,"University of California, Berkeley; University of Chicago","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The origin of Mercury’s enhanced iron content is a matter of ongoing debate. The characterization of rocky exoplanets promises to provide new independent insights on this topic by constraining the occurrence rate and physical and orbital properties of iron-enhanced planets orbiting distant stars. The ultra-short-period transiting planet candidate KOI-1843.03 (0.6 Earth-radius, 4.245 hour orbital period) represents the first exo-Mercury planet candidate ever identified. For KOI-1843.03 to have avoided tidal disruption on such a short orbit, it must have a mean density of at least 7g/cc and be at least as iron rich as Mercury (Rappaport et al. 2013). In contrast, Dressing et al. (2015) have noted that, to date, all confirmed transiting small (< 1.5 Earth-radius) exoplanets with masses measured to better than 20% precision have mean densities that are consistent with Earth-like bulk compositions, though significant compositional dispersion is also admitted within the observational uncertainties. This presentation will describe the application of hierarchical Bayesian models to constrain the underlying distribution of rocky exoplanet iron contents from a sample of noisy mass-radius measurements coupled to rocky planet interior structure models. In addition to deriving constraints on the distribution of iron-enhanced exo-Mercuries from the exoplanet mass-radius measurements in hand, we also apply this approach to simulated data sets to predict how the constraints should improve as increasing numbers of exoplanets are characterized. The work outlines an observational pathway toward using exoplanets to place Mercury into context.\n",1,

Zielinski,Sessioned,Eckerd College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We introduce a new approach to a century-old assumption which enhances not only planetary interior calculations but also high-pressure material physics. We show that the polytropic index is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We then augment the traditional polytrope theory by including a variable polytrope index within the confines of the Lane–Emden differential equation. To investigate the possibilities of this method, we create a high-quality universal equation of state, transforming the traditional polytrope method to a tool with the potential for excellent predictive power. The theoretical foundation of our equation of state is the same elastic observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index, the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We calculate the density–pressure of six common materials up to 10<sup>18</sup> Pa, mass–radius relationships for the same materials, and produce plausible density–radius models for the rocky planets of our Solar system. We argue that the bulk modulus and its derivatives have been underutilized in previous planet formation methods. We constrain the material surface observables for the inner core, outer core, and mantle of planet Earth in a systematic way including pressure, bulk modulus, and the polytrope index in the analysis. We believe that this variable polytrope method has the necessary apparatus to be extended further to gas giants and stars.

It therefore seems reasonable to assume that many terrestrial planets lack a Jupiter-like companion. We use a recently developed, state-of-the-art N-body model that allows for collisional fragmentation to perform hundreds of numerical simulations of the final stages of terrestrial planet formation around a Sun-like star -- with and without giant outer planets. We quantify the effects that outer giant planet companions have on collisions and the planet accretion process.

Meadows,Sessioned,UCLA/Harvard; University of Washington; NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): As lower-mass stars often host multiple rocky planets, gravitational interactions among planets can have significant effects on climate and habitability over long timescales. Here we explore a specific case, Kepler-62f (Borucki et al., 2013), a potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system with a K2V host star. <i>N</i>-body integrations reveal the stable range of initial eccentricities for Kepler-62f is 0.00 ≤ e ≤ 0.32, absent the effect of additional, undetected planets. We simulate the tidal evolution of Kepler-62f in this range and find that, for certain assumptions, the planet can be locked in a synchronous rotation state. Simulations using the three-dimensional (3-D) “Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique” (LMD) Generic global climate model (GCM) indicate that the surface habitability of this planet is sensitive to orbital configuration. With 3 bars of CO<sub>2</sub> in its atmosphere, we find that Kepler-62f would only be warm enough for surface liquid water at the upper limit of this eccentricity range, providing it has a high planetary obliquity (between 60<sup>°</sup> and 90<sup>°</sup>). A climate similar to modern-day Earth is possible for the entire range of stable eccentricities if atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is increased to 5-bar levels. In a low-CO<sub>2</sub> case (Earth-like levels), simulations with version 4 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) GCM indicate that increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near pericenter permit regions of the planet with above-freezing surface temperatures. This may melt ice sheets formed during colder seasons. If Kepler-62f is synchronously rotating and has an ocean, CO<sub>2</sub> levels above 3 bars would be required to distribute enough heat to the night side of the planet to avoid atmospheric freeze-out and permit a large enough region of open water at the planet’s substellar point to remain stable. Overall, we find multiple plausible combinations of orbital and atmospheric properties that permit surface liquid water on Kepler-62f.\n",4,

Also discussed are the flare properties of cooler, commonplace main-sequence K-M stars.

These studies are based on ground-based observations, UV and X-ray space missions (<i>IUE</i> & <i>HST, ROSAT & Chandra</i>) as well as a wealth of data from the <i>Kepler Mission</i>. The ultra-high precision photometry available from the <i>Kepler Mission</i> (and <i>K2</i>) has made it possible to study starspots, flare properties, and rotations of thousands of G, K, M stars. Superflares (defined as E > 10+33 ergs ~X-100 flares) on hundreds of mostly G and K stars have been found.

Using our Age-Rotation relations, we determine correlations of flares properties of the Sun and solar-type over a wide range of ages. We also compare these flare histories with the cooler, more common K- and M-type stars. The analysis of these datasets imply that the young Sun had numerous, very powerful flares that may have played major roles the evolution of the early atmospheres of Earth and other terrestrial planets. The strong X-UV fluxes and proton fluences from flares and associated plasmas from coronal mass ejection events can greatly affect the photochemistry of planetary atmospheres as well as ionizing and possibly eroding their atmospheres. Some examples are given. Also discussed are the effects of superflares from the present Sun on the Earth.

Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the magnitude of HAT-P-13b's eccentricity is in part dictated by its Love number, i.e. the degree of central mass concentration in its interior. We can therefore directly constrain the fraction of HAT-P-13b's mass contained in its core by measuring its orbital eccentricity. This method offers considerable advantages over the standard approach of inferring core size based on mass and radius measurements alone. In this study we derive new constraints on the value of HAT-P-13b’s eccentricity by observing two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. We fit the measured secondary eclipse times simultaneously with radial velocity measurements and find that the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b is 0.00696 ± 0.00096. We then use octupole-order secular perturbation theory to find that the corresponding Love number is 0.31 (+0.11, -0.05). Applying structural evolution models, we then find, with 68% confidence, that the core mass lies between 0-25 Earth masses, with a most likely value of the core mass of 11 Earth masses. This is the tightest constraint, to date, on the core mass of an exoplanet. We also compare the measured secondary eclipse depths, in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands, to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and find that the depths are best matched by models with a dayside temperature inversion and relatively efficient day-night circulation.\n",7,

Hence, the frequency of Li-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 ± 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 ± 1.1)% for the AGB, and (0.3 ± 0.1)% for all giants.  Because the Li-rich RGB stars are on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the luminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB stars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous giants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash.  (2) All post-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass transfer.  This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear Li-rich due to mass transfer from a recently Li-enhanced companion.  This frequency is at the lower end of our confidence interval.\n",6,

Bildsten,Sessioned,California Institute of Technology; Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics; University of Sydney; CEA,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Internal stellar magnetic fields are inaccessible to direct observations and little is known about their amplitude, geometry and evolution. I will discuss how strong magnetic fields in the cores of red giant stars can be identified with asteroseismology. The fields manifest themselves via depressed dipole stellar oscillation modes, which arises from a magnetic greenhouse effect that scatters and traps oscillation mode energy within the core of the star. Physically, the effect stems from magnetic tension forces created by sufficiently strong fields, which break the spherical symmetry of the wave propagation cavity. The loss of wave energy within the core reduces the mode visibility at the stellar surface, and we find that our predicted visibilities are in excellent agreement with a class of red giants exhibiting depressed dipole oscillation modes. The Kepler satellite has already observed hundreds of these red giants, which we identify as stars with strongly magnetized cores. Field strengths larger than roughly 10^5 G can produce the observed depression, and in one case we measure a core field strength of 10^7 G.\n",7,

VLA and ALMA observations of the stellar SiO maser lines give accurate line-of-sight velocities and positions, thus the SiO stars are used as point-mass tracers of the dynamics. These new kinematic probes will be used to significantly improve our understanding of the dynamics and structure of the bulge and inner Galaxy and may help clarifying the range of age in the bulge population. With these data it will be possible to find kinematic substructures, e.g., traces of dwarf galaxies that have been ingested by the bulge over the past ~1-3 Gyr. Complementary near-infrared spectroscopy will be performed for a subsample of the stars, and higher resolution VLBA observations will be used to determine proper motions, parallaxes and orbit families for a subset of sources.

Detailed studies of nearby galaxies provides guidance for interpreting the more distant forming galaxies. JWST/MIRI will enable stellar population studies akin to work done with HST on the Local Group galaxies but over a new wavelength range. MIRI’s imaging capability over nine photometric bands from 5 to 28 microns is particularly suited to survey stars with an infrared excess and to detangle the extinction or thermal emission from various species of dust. These dusty stellar populations include young stellar objects, evolved stars and supernovae that are bright in the infrared. Using the rich Spitzer-IRS spectroscopic dataset and spectral classifications from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE)-Spectroscopic survey of over a thousand objects in the Magellanic Clouds, we calculate the expected flux –densities and colors in the MIRI broadband filters for these prominent infrared sources. We uses these fluxes to illustrate what JWST will see in stellar population studies for other Local Group galaxies. JWST/MIRI observations of infrared sources in Local Group Galaxies will constrain the life cycle of galaxies through their dust emission. For example, how much of the interstellar dust is supplied by dying stars? Do the number of young stellar objects agree with star formation diagnostic for the galaxy? We discuss the locations of the post- and pre–main-sequence populations in MIRI color-color and color–magnitude space and examine which filters are best for identifying populations of sources. We connect these results to existing galaxies with HST data for instance Andromeda and M33.\n",9,

Furthermore, another class of seemingly distinct type of absorbers, ultra-fast outflows or UFOs, is becoming increasingly known today. Nonetheless, a physical identification of such absorbers, such as geometrical property and physical conditions, is very elusive to date despite the recent state-of-the-art observations. We develop a coherent scenario in which the detected absorbers are driven primarily (if not exclusively) by the action of global magnetic fields originating from a black hole accretion disk.

All other known violent, rapid explosions, including gamma-ray bursts and supernovae, are believed to destroy the object in the process. Here, we report the discovery of a second class of non-destructive, highly energetic rapidly flaring X-ray object located within two nearby galaxies with fundamentally different properties than soft gamma repeaters/anomalous X-ray pulsars. One source is located within a suspected globular cluster of the host galaxy and flared one time, while the other source is located in either a globular cluster of the host galaxy or the core of a stripped dwarf companion galaxy that flared on five occasions over a seven year time span. When not flaring, the sources appear as normal accreting neutron star or black hole X-ray binaries, indicating that the flare event does not significantly disrupt the host system.

This signified the beginning of a time known as the Dark Ages. Neutral matter began to fall into the dark matter gravitational wells that were seeded after the initial moments of the Big Bang. As the first stars and galaxies formed within these gravitational wells, the surrounding baryonic matter was heated and started to ionize. The source of energetic photons that heated and reionized the early Universe remains uncertain. Early galaxies had low metallicity and recent population synthesis calculations suggest that the number and luminosity of high-mass X-ray binaries are enhanced in star-forming galaxies with low metallicity, offering a potentially important and previously overlooked source of heating and reionization. Here we examine two types of local galaxies that have been shown to be good analogs to the early galaxies in the Universe: Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) and Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs).<br /><br />A BCD is defined by its blue optical colors, low metallicities, and physically small size. This makes BCDs the best available local analogs for early star formation. We analyzed data from a sample of 25 metal-poor BCDs and compared our results with those of near-solar metallicity galaxies. Using a Bayesian approach, we showed that the X-ray luminosity function for the low-metallicity BCDs is significantly elevated relative to the XLF for near-solar metallicity galaxies.<br /><br />Larger, gas-rich galaxies may have formed shortly after these first galaxies. These larger galaxies would be similar in their properties to the high-redshift Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). LBAs provide the best local comparison to the LBGs. We studied a sample of 10 LBAs in order to measure the relation between star formation rate and X-ray luminosity for these galaxies. We found that for LBAs with intermediate sub-solar metallicities, there is enhanced X-ray emission relative to the expected value from near-solar metallicity galaxies.<br /><br />By incorporating our results into simulations used to predict the redshifted 21cm signal from the early Universe, unique and observable predictions could be made for future 21cm observations.\n",3,

Although extreme variability is commonplace in its light-curve, about half of the observations of GRS1915+105 show fairly steady X-ray intensity. We report on the X-ray spectral behavior within these steady observations. Our work is based on a vast RXTE/PCA data set obtained on GRS 1915+105 during the course of its entire mission and 10 years of radio data from the Ryle Telescope, which overlap the X-ray data. We find that the steady observations within the X-ray data set naturally separate into two regions in a color-color diagram, which we refer to as steady-soft and steady-hard. GRS 1915+105 displays significant curvature in the Comptonization component within the PCA band pass suggesting significantly heating from a hot disk present in all states. A new Comptonization model 'simplcut' was developed in order to model this curvature to best effect. A majority of the steady-soft observations display a roughly constant inner radius; remarkably reminiscent of canonical soft state black hole binaries. In contrast, the steady-hard observations display a growing disk truncation that is correlated to the mass accretion rate through the disk, which suggests a magnetically truncated disk. A comparison of X-ray model parameters to the canonical state definitions show that almost all steady-soft observations match the criteria of either thermal or steep power law state, while the thermal state observations dominate the constant radius branch. A large portion (80%) of the steady-hard observations matches the hard state criteria when the disk fraction constraint is neglected. These results suggest that within the complexity of this source is a simpler underlying basis of states, which map to those observed in canonical black hole binaries. When represented in a color-color diagram, state assignments appear to map to ``A, B and C'' (Belloni et al. 2000) regions that govern fast variability cycles in GRS 1915+105 demonstrating a compelling link between short and long time scales in its phenomenology.\n",5,

Van Den Eijnden*,J. Van Den Eijnden*; A. Ingram; P. Uttley,Sessioned,University of Amsterdam,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Accreting stellar-mass black holes display quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray flux with a period that drifts from approximately 0.05 to 10 seconds. Since the oscillatory signal originates from the close proximity of the black hole, QPOs provide a diagnostic of the motion of matter in this region of extreme gravitational curvature. Here I present an analysis of the energy dependence of QPOs in the black hole binary GRS 1915+105. The QPO period in this black hole binary is known to be correlated with the observed energy band. To investigate this further, we extract light curves in two broad energy bands using archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and apply a filter that separates the QPO from the coincident noise. The filtered light curves reveal that, in both energy bands, the modulation repeatedly rises and falls in amplitude in an envelope that typically lasts about five to ten QPO cycles. We find that, during each of these so-called coherence timescales, the phase difference between the two QPO light curves increases before resetting at the start of the next coherence time scale. This indicates that the oscillation in one energy band is genuinely faster than that in the other band, and puts interesting constraints on current QPO models. If the QPO originates from vertical general relativistic precession of the inner accretion flow, our result indicates that the inner regions of this flow precess slightly quicker than the outer regions, with the precession phase resetting after five to ten QPO cycles.\n",7,

Direct measurement of magnetic field strength is observationally challenging, however observations of polarized thermal emission from dust grains aligned with respect to the local cloud magnetic field can be used to map out the magnetic field orientation in molecular clouds.  Statistical comparisons between these submillimeter polarization maps and three-dimensional numerical simulations of magnetized star-forming clouds provide a promising method for constraining magnetic field strength. We present early results from a BLASTPol study of the nearby giant molecular cloud (GMC) Vela C, using data collected during a 2012 Antarctic flight.  This sensitive balloon-borne polarimeter observed Vela C for 57 hours, yielding the most detailed submillimeter polarization map ever made of a GMC forming high mass stars. We find that most of the structure in p can be modeled by a power-law dependence on two quantities: the hydrogen column density and the local dispersion in magnetic field orientation.

Togi*,A. Togi*; J. T. Smith,Sessioned,University of Toledo,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): <br />Robust knowledge of the molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas distribution is necessary to understand star formation in galaxies. Since H<sub>2</sub> is not readily observable in the cold interstellar medium (ISM), the molecular gas content has traditionally been inferred using indirect tracers like carbon-monoxide (CO), dust emission, gamma ray interactions, and star formation efficiency. Physical processes resulting in enhancement and reduction of these indirect tracers can result in misleading estimates of molecular gas masses. My dissertation work is based on devising a new temperature power law distribution model for warm H<sub>2</sub>, a direct tracer, to calculate the total molecular gas mass in galaxies. The model parameters are estimated using mid infrared (MIR) H<sub>2</sub> rotational line fluxes, obtained from IRS- Spitzer (InfraRed Spectrograph- Spitzer) instrument, and the model can be extrapolated to a suitable lower temperature to recover the total molecular gas mass. The power law model is able to recover the dark molecular gas, undetected by CO, in low metallicity galaxies. Using the power law model in the coming era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the high sensitivity MIR Instrument (MIRI) spectrograph we will be able to understand the properties of molecular gas at low and high redshifts.\n",2,

The new conversion law replaces the use of the single ""X-factor"" in widespread use, with a more physically-based relationship between the CO line's optical depth, excitation, and column density. The new law is based on a simple yet robust radiative transfer analysis of the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O line ratios across this area of the Galactic Plane, and also incorporates a temperature-dependent term from a similar study of the California Cloud by Kong et al (2015). It is N = 1.8x10^24 H2 molecules m–2 (I(CO)/K km s–1)^1.4 * (Tex/10 K)^–0.7. It has the effect of increasing the inferred mass column, over the single X-factor, by typically a factor of 2–3. This means that the molecular mass of the Milky Way may have been substantially underestimated in previous studies, and suggests that scaling laws like the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations may also need to be recalibrated.

Observations of RRLs allow us to measure source velocities and determine positions within the Galaxy using a rotation curve model, but until recently our sample in the far outer Galaxy was incomplete. Using HI and CO data, Dame & Thaddeus (2011) identified an extension of the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, deemed the Outer Scutum-Centaurus arm, or OSC. This arm offers a new laboratory for the study of Galactic structure, high-mass star formation, and chemistry of the outer Galaxy. We searched for new Galactic HII regions in the OSC by targeting infrared-identified candidates that have an (l,b) location consistent with this arm. We have discovered 10 OSC HII regions thus far, using observations of: (1) VLA 9 GHz continuum to identify thermally emitting sources, (2) GBT RRLs to detect evolved HII regions, and (3) GBT NH3 to detect younger HII regions. Detected regions lie at an average Heliocentric distance of 20.0 ± 1.4 kpc and an average Galactocentric distance of 14.5 ± 1.4 kpc. The most distant region detected has a Heliocentric distance of 23.5 kpc and a Galactocentric distance of 17.0 kpc. These are the most distant known Galactic high-mass star formation regions. We will present the results of ongoing NH3 observations with the GBT, which will likely increase the sample of OSC HII regions further.\n",7,

The talk focuses on investigating arguably one of the most often applied statistical analyses in clouds and filaments recently--<b>the probability distribution function (PDF) analysis of column density</b>. We look at the correlation between column density PDF and various physical processes including turbulence and star formation as traced by young stellar objects and star forming cores, in both observation and simulation; as well as potential problems in statistically consistent fitting of column density distribution, validating correlation, biased sample selection, and projection effects. Our results show that 1) even though on large scale, the ""width"" of the column density PDF seems to correlate with turbulence, <i>no clear correlation is found between column density PDF and turbulence in both simulation and observation</i>, and 2) even previous works show that the index of the ""power-law tail"" correlates with the star formation activity, <i>there is statistical ambiguity in the sampling of column density structures and associating point sources with any of these structures</i>. We further analyze the hierachical structures of column density in molecular clouds and filaments, using the structure extraction algorithm, the dendrogram.\n",8,

To understand the origin of this deficit, we measure the SFR efficiency of atomic gas at z~1, z~2, and z~3 to investigate possible coevolution with galactic properties. We use new robust photometric redshifts to create galaxy stacks in these three redshift bins, and measure the SFR efficiency by combining DLA absorber statistics with the observed rest-frame UV emission in the galaxies' outskirts. Contrary to simulations and models that predict a reduced SFR efficiency with decreasing metallicity and thus with increasing redshift, we find no significant evolution in the SFR efficiency. We conclude that the reduced SFR efficiency is driven by the low molecular content of this atomic-dominated phase, with metallicity playing a second order effect in regulating the conversion between atomic and molecular gas. This interpretation is supported by the similarity between the observed SFR efficiency and that observed in local atomic-dominated gas, such as in the outskirts of local spiral galaxies or local dwarf galaxies.\n",1,

We fit all of these galaxies' light profiles with a single S\'ersic fits, as well as with a combination of exponential and S\'ersic profile. The latter is done in order to describe a galaxy with a disk and a bulge. We use three classification method (visual, F-test and the RFF method) to separate our sample into one-component galaxies (disk/spheroids-like galaxies) and 2-component galaxies (galaxies formed by a bulge and a disk). We then compare the results from using these three different ways to classify our galaxies. We find that the fraction of galaxies selected as 2-component galaxies increases on average 50% from the lowest mass bin to the most massive galaxies, and decreases with redshift by a factor of four from z=1 to z=3. We furthermore examine how the sizes of the bulges and disks components in these galaxies evolve with time as well as the dependence of stellar mass on these results.

Chiang*,Sessioned,UT Austin,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Proto-clusters, the progenitor large-scale structures of present day galaxy clusters, are unique laboratories to study dark matter assembly, cosmic baryon cycle, galaxy growth, and environmental impact on galaxy evolution. In this dissertation talk, I will present our recent progress in this subject, both theoretical and observational. Using a set of cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic galaxy models, we extract the mass, size, and overdensity evolution for ∼3000 simulated clusters from z=8 to z=0. In line with the scenario of cosmic downsizing, the models predict that the fraction of cosmic star formation rate occurs in (proto-)clusters increases from <1% at z=0 to 20–30% at z=8. This result demonstrates that the seemingly sharp distinction when discussing field and cluster galaxy evolution has to be blurred at high redshift, and a significant fraction of cosmic reionization was done by cluster progenitors. Observationally, we focus on the epoch of z≈2 when the first cluster scale halos (10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) were about to form. We perform a systematic proto-cluster search using a photometric redshift catalog in the COSMOS field, revealing a large sample of 36 candidate proto-clusters at 1.6<z<3.1. Several structures in this catalog have been confirmed spectroscopically. I will present the confirmation and detailed characterization of a ``proto-Virgo'' cluster in this field at z=2.44 with M<sub>z=0</sub> = 10<sup>14.5±0.4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> using a sample of Lyα emitters (LAE) in the HETDEX Pilot Survey with a highly homogeneous selection function in 3D redshift space. Compared to the cosmic mean, this structure shows a LAE overdensity of 4 on a scale of few tens cMpc, a 5 times higher fraction of extended Lya blobs, a 2 times higher median stellar mass of NIR selected galaxies with photometric redshift, and a significantly enhanced intergalactic gas revealed in the Lyα absorption maps of Lee et al.

With these results, I will discuss proto-clusters in the context of cluster formation and galaxy evolution, highlighting their unique roles linking scales from large to small, and epochs form active star-formation to quenching.\n",3,

However, the spectral features used to measure the metallicity are shifted out of the wavelength range of current spectrographs at high-z and therefore alternative methods must be used.<br />We measure the relation between four prominent UV absorption complexes and metallicity for more than 50 local galaxies and, by using a sample of more than 20 galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3, verify that this relation holds up to z ∼ 3. We then apply this method to a sample of ∼ 220 galaxies at 3.5 < z < 6.0 in COSMOS, for which unique UV spectra from DEIMOS and accurate stellar mass estimates from SPLASH are available. The z ~ 5 galaxies at 9 < log(m/M<sub>⊙</sub>) < 11 are characterized by 0.3 - 0.4 dex (in units of 12 + log(O/H)) lower metallicities than galaxies at z ∼ 2 but comparable to z ∼ 3 − 3.5 galaxies. In the same stellar mass range, we do not find a significant relation between stellar mass and metallicity (MZ relation), suggesting that the MZ relation at z ~ 5 is very shallow or breaking down. Since we verify a correlation between dust obscuration (measured by β) and UV absorption strength (i.e., metallicity), we argue that the process of dust production and metal enrichment in the first billion years of galaxy formation is more stochastic than at later times. Using a “bathtub” model approach, we find that an exponential build up of stellar mass within a short time of several 100 Myr can explain a shallow MZ relation at z ∼ 5. Furthermore, we find a weak anti-correlation between star-formation rates and UV absorption strength (i.e., metallicity), indicative of these galaxies being fueled by the inflow of pristine (metal-poor) gas. The galaxy sample presented in this work is unique to further test these scenarios using ALMA and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\n",5,

However, no evidence of this transition has been found in many high redshift galaxy surveys including CFHTLS, CANDELS and SPLASH, the first studies to probe the high-mass end at these redshifts. Indeed, if halo mass to stellar mass ratios estimated at lower-redshift continue to z ~ 6-8, CANDELS and SPLASH report several orders of magnitude more M ~ 10^<sup>12-13 </sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> halos than are possible to have formed by those redshifts, implying these massive galaxies formed impossibly early. We consider various systematics in the stellar synthesis models used to estimate physical parameters and possible galaxy formation scenarios in an effort to reconcile observation with theory. Although known uncertainties can greatly reduce the disparity between recent observations and cold dark matter merger simulations, even taking the most conservative view of the observations, there remains considerable tension with current theory.\n",6,

The formation of XRBs is sensitive to galaxy properties like stellar age and metallicity---properties that have evolved significantly in the broader galaxy population throughout cosmic history. The 6 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) allows us to study how XRB emission has evolved over a significant fraction of cosmic history (since z ~ 4), without significant contamination from AGN. Using constraints from the CDF-S, I will show that the X-ray emission from normal galaxies from z = 0-7 depends not only on star-formation rate (SFR), but also on stellar mass (M) and redshift. Our analysis shows the that low-mass X-ray binary emission scales with stellar mass and evolves as LX(LMXB)/M ~ (1+z)^3, and high-mass X-ray binaries scale with SFR and evolve as LX(HMXB)/SFR ~ (1+z), consistent with predictions from population synthesis models, which attribute the increase in LMXB and HMXB scaling relations with redshift as being due to declining host galaxy stellar ages and metallicities, respectively. These findings have important implications for the X-ray emission from young, low-metallicity galaxies at high redshift, which are likely to be more X-ray luminous per SFR and play a significant role in the heating of the intergalactic medium.\n",8,

The LISA design has been studied for more than 20 years as a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency. LISA consists of three Sun-orbiting spacecraft that form an equilateral triangle, with each side measuring 1-5 million kilometers in length. Each spacecraft houses two free-floating test masses, which are protected from all disturbing forces so that they follow pure geodesics. A single test mass together with its protective housing and associated components is referred to as a gravitational reference sensor. A drag-free control system is supplied with measurements of the test mass position from these sensors and commands external micronewton thrusters to force the spacecraft to fly in formation with the test masses. Laser interferometry is used to measure the minute variations in the distance, or light travel time, between these purely free-falling TMs, caused by gravitational waves. We have constructed a new torsion pendulum facility with a force sensitivity in the range of pN/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> around 1 mHz for testing new gravitational reference sensor technologies. This experimental facility consists of a vacuum enclosed torsion pendulum that suspends mock-ups of the LISA test masses, surrounded by their electrode housings.

Given the availability of “big data” on quasars, including the SDSS DR12 and the recently released DES data set, a robust automated algorithm for the detection of lensed quasars is rapidly becoming a necessity. We report results from an automated search for lensed quasars consisting of two complementary algorithms: a morphological algorithm directed at finding wide-separation lens candidates and a PSF-difference-based algorithm aimed at identifying close-separation lens candidates. This research started with a baseline data set of over 450,000 quasars and 996,317 spatial neighbors within 16 arcseconds of each quasar in the SDSS DR12. This threshold can identify quasars lensed by galaxy-scale to cluster-scale matter concentrations. The first part of the automated method matched redshift and color characteristics of images and compared key emission lines in the spectrum of the quasars and their neighbors. The second portion applied image segmentation techniques to deblend close-separation candidates identified as one photometric object by SDSS. Cross-matching with observations of the same targets across other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and elimination of confirmed binary quasars increased the confidence level of the resulting candidate list. The automated search efficiently produced output consistent with results reported in the literature.

Sampson,Sessioned,Montana State Univ.; Northwestern University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Precision timing of highly stable milli-second pulsars is a promising technique for detecting very low frequency sources of gravitational waves. In any one pulsar, the gravitational wave signal appears as an additional source of timing noise, and it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of pulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In the limit where there are many gravitational wave sources, or in the limit where there are many pulsars in the array, the waves produce a unique tensor correlation pattern that depends only on the angular separation of each pulsar pair. It is this distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays. Here we consider how the prospects for detection are diminished when there are a finite number of signals and pulsars, which breaks the statistical isotropy of the timing array and of the gravitational wave sky. We also study the use of ""sky-scrambles'' to break the signal correlations in the data as a way to increase confidence in a detection.\n",8,

We consider here a low-redshift (z<0.06), volume-limited subsample of ~8,000 GAMA galaxies that have been morphologically classified by the survey team. In order to quantify the separate bulge and disk properties of these galaxies, we apply a large-scale automated procedure for fitting images with 2D, multi-component structure models, including evaluation of fit convergence using a grid of input parameter values for each galaxy. From this analysis, we calculate the total bulge and disk contributions to the local galaxy stellar mass budget and derive mass-size relations for both pure spheroid/disk systems and the separate bulge/disk components of multi-component galaxies. We further examine the fraction of total stellar mass assembled in spheroid and disk structures as a function of galaxy environment, where environment is quantified on multiple scales from membership in large-scale filaments to groups/clusters and down to local pairings. We then discuss the effect of environmental conditions on the mechanisms of stellar mass assembly, including the implied balance between merger accumulation and in situ mass growth in different environment regimes.<br />\n",1,

Mapping of the LSS is done with two complementary techniques, and together they provide both a local measure of the density field and a more global characterization of the environment of a galaxy, thereby allowing for a more complete measure of a galaxy's environment. I have applied this LSS mapping technique to the entire Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic galaxy sample at z<0.05, divided into multiple redshift bins, to explore the environmental dependence on galaxy evolution over a significant volume and a large dynamic range of environments. I will also present a more focused study looking at the molecular gas content of galaxies in two clusters at z~0.2, based on a program I am leading with the Large Millimeter Telescope that has obtained CO spectroscopy for ~70 galaxies with a range of stellar masses, atomic gas masses, and different parts of projected phase space around the two clusters. This molecular gas study provides a detailed statistical look at how the molecular and atomic gas contents of galaxies are affected by the environmental processes in their host clusters.

Smith,Sessioned,Yonsei University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Isolated galaxies in low-density environments are considered not to be perturbed by other galaxies at least for the last few Gyr, and thus they are important in the sense that they are least affected by the hierarchical mergers and interactions. To figure out the properties of isolated galaxies and their star-formation histories, we select isolated galaxies and their comparison sample in relatively denser environments from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. The samples in the redshift range of 0.025 < z < 0.044 are volume-limited. The galaxies are classified based on the Hubble morphology classification scheme through a visual inspection. The catalog of Oh et al. (2011) is used for the spectroscopic study. Although we have found most of the photometric and spectroscopic properties are similar between the isolated and comparison sample galaxies, there are some differences between the samples. The most remarkable results are as follows. Late-type galaxies are dominant in isolated galaxies with the morphology distribution (E:S0:S:Irr) = (9.9:11.3:77.6:1.2)%. The percentage of elliptical galaxies among isolated galaxies is only a third of that of the comparison sample (E:S0:S:Irr) = (28.6:18.1:52.7:0.6)%. Isolated elliptical galaxies are less massive by 50% and younger by 20% in luminosity-weighted age than their counterparts, while spiral galaxies in isolated and comparison samples do not show any significant differences. This can be explained as a result of different merger and star-formation histories for differing environments in the hierarchical merger paradigm. We provide an online catalog for the list and properties of our sample galaxies.\n",3,

L. Hallenbeck*,G. L. Hallenbeck*,Sessioned,Union College,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the standard ΛCDM cosmology, galaxies form via mergers of many smaller dark matter halos. Because mergers drive star formation, the most massive galaxies should also be the ones which have been the most efficient at converting their gas reservoirs into stars. This trend is seen observationally: in general, as stellar mass increases, gas fraction (GF = M<sub>HI</sub>/M<sub>*</sub>) decreases. Galaxies which have large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen (HI) are thus expected to be extremely rare, which was seemingly supported by earlier blind HI surveys.<br /><br />In seeming contradiction, ALFALFA, the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey has observed a sample of 34 galaxies which are both massive (M<sub>HI</sub>>10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) and have unusually high gas fractions (all ≥ 0.3; half are > 1). We call this sample HighMass. Unlike other extremely HI-massive samples, such galaxies are neither low surface brightness galaxies nor are they simply “scaled up” spirals. Could this gas be recently acquired, either from accreting small companions or directly from the cosmic web? Or is it primordial, and has been kept from forming stars, possibly because of an unusually high dark matter halo spin parameter?<br /><br />We present resolved HI, H<sub>2</sub>, and star formation properties of three of these HIghMass galaxies, and compare them with two HIghMass galaxies previously discussed in Hallenbeck <i>et al.</i> (2014). One of these galaxies, UGC 6168, appears in the process of transitioning from a quiescent to star-forming phase, as indicated by its bar and potential non-circular flows. A second, UGC 7899, has a clear warp, which could be evidence of recently accreted gas—but the presence of a warp is far from conclusive evidence. Both have moderately high dark matter halo spin parameters (λ' = 0.09), similar to the previously studied UGC 9037. The third, NGC 5230, looks undisturbed both optically and in its radio emission, but is in a group full of extragalactic gas. A neighboring galaxy has been significantly disrupted, and NGC 5230 may be in the process of acquiring some of its neighbor's removed gas.<br /><br />This work has been supported by NSF-AST-0606007, AST-1107390, and AST-1211005, grants from the Brinson Foundation, and a Student Observing Support award from NRAO.\n",5,

Hartmann*,D. Hartmann*,Sessioned,Clemson Univ.,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) holds answers to many questions of moderrn cosmology. The origin of the CMB lies in the early universe, and when it was released during the recombination phase the conditions were not yet right for new sources of light. But the first generation of stars born in a mostly neutral universe quickly re-ionized their surroubding baryonic environments, and dust was produced which allowed reprocessing of some star light into the infrared specral region. Black holes and other compact objects were born and the emissions from their accretion processes and relativistic jetted outflws contributed new light. Today, we observe this evolving radiation field as the Extragalactic Backgroud Light (EBL), ranging from the radio- to the gamma-ray band. The evolution of the diffuse electromagnetic energy content of the universe is the focus of this special session, and I will discuss its importance within the context of modern cosmology. I will emphasize the role of gamma-ray astronomy, which probes the EBL and the CMB through the opacity created by photon-photon pair production.\n",1,

B. Zemcov*,M. B. Zemcov*,Sessioned,Rochester Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The near IR extragalactic background light (EBL) encodes the integrated light production over cosmic history, so represents the total emission from all galaxies along the line of sight up to ancient first-light objects present during the epoch of reionization (EOR).  This EOR emission necessarily comprises part of the background, and indeed a minimum level is required to supply enough photons to ionize the intergalactic medium, corresponding to an EBL brightness less than 1 nW m^-2 sr^-1, about one tenth of the integrated galactic light (IGL).  In addition to emission from these IGL and EOR populations, low surface brightness tidal streams of stars stripped by gravitational interactions during galaxy formation at low redshifts, called intrahalo light (IHL), may also contribute a significant fraction of the EBL.  Models for these components can be constrained both through direct photometric measurements, as well as the new technique of EBL anisotropy intensity mapping that takes advantage of the fact that the Zodiacal Light is spatially smooth while distant populations produce anisotropies with distinct spatial and spectral characteristics.  This talk will present recent results from the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (CIBER), a sounding rocket borne payload designed to measure both the fluctuations and direct photometric emission of the extra-galactic background light.  The anisotropy of the near-IR EBL suggests the presence of a bright component approximately as bright as the IGL component near 1 micron which we interpret as the aggregate emission from low-redshift IHL.  New direct photometric measurements from CIBER's low resolution spectrometer will also be discussed.\n",2,

Khaire*,V. Khaire*; R.

At any given epoch, it carries an imprint of the integrated cosmic star formation rate and quasar activity till that epoch. The EBL cannot be observed directly because of its low surface brightness beyond the local universe and one has to rely on the theoretical estimates. To obtain the EBL theoretically, one requires an accurate estimate of the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), and the quasar emissivity. The estimates of SFRD are known to be degenerate with the amount of dust correction. To resolve this degeneracy, we present a novel 'progressive fitting method', which uses observed multi-wavelength and multi-epoch galaxy luminosity function measurements and determines a unique combination of the average SFRD(z) and dust attenuation A<sub>FUV</sub>(z) in the far ultraviolet band (FUV band; central wavelength~1500 Angstrom) for a given extinction curve. Using this method and the available observations, we determine the combinations of SFRD(z) and A<sub>FUV</sub>(z) up to z~8 for five well known extinction curves. The comparison with the independent SFRD(z), A<sub>FUV</sub>(z) and local infrared emissivity measurements from the literature with our predictions favor an extinction curve similar to that of Large Magellanic Cloud Supershell (LMC2). We update the quasar emissivity using the recent quasar luminosity function (QLF) measurements which show a factor of ~2 increase as compared to the previous QLFs at z<2. We show, the EBL estimated using this updated quasar emissivity and the SFRD(z) for LMC2 extinction curve resolves the problem of 'photon underproduction crisis' at low redshift. The EBL consistently reproduces the recent measurements of γ-ray horizon and the pair-production optical depths of γ-rays from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The effect of the updated EBL on the inferred properties of intergalactic medium, particularly in the extreme ultraviolet regime, will be discussed.\n",3,

This quantity has been proposed by several authors to indicate the presence of axion-like particles or secondary cascades induced by cosmic rays. The Fermi-LAT has now provided a large sample of sources detected both at VHE and HE with comparable exposure that allows us to test models of extragalactic γ-ray photon propagation. We find that our data are compatible with simulations that include intrinsic blazar curvature and EBL attenuation. Therefore, we conclude that no alternative scenario is necessary to explain the observed softening of blazar spectra with redshift. There is also no evidence of evolution with redshift of the physics that drives the photon emission in high-frequency synchrotron peak (HSP) blazars.

These pairs can Compton-scatter the cosmic microwave background, creating a gamma-ray signature at slightly lower energies observable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).  This signal is strongly dependent on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength (B) and its coherence length (L_B).  We constrain these parameters by combining LAT spectra with IACT spectra taken from the literature for 5 VHE-detected BL Lac objects.  Low B values can be ruled out by the constraint that the cascade flux cannot exceed that observed by the LAT.  High values of B can be ruled out from the constraint that the EBL-deabsorbed IACT spectrum cannot be greater than the LAT spectrum extrapolated into the VHE band, unless the cascade spectrum contributes a sizable fraction of the LAT flux.

Kallman,Sessioned,NASA/GSFC; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Galactic center is a hotbed of astrophysical phenomena. The ~30 evolved massive stars orbiting the super massive black hole (SMBH) on scales <10"" inject a large fraction of the matter that accretes onto the SMBH, and their wind-wind collisions create large swaths of shocked, hot, X-ray emitting material around Sgr A*. The 3Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Program of the Galactic center provided unprecedented detail of this region by resolving the diffuse thermal emission around the SMBH, and also revealed the presence of SMBH feedback into its immediate surroundings. With the original intent of computing the accretion onto the SMBH, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with various feedback prescriptions modeled the 30 Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting the SMBH over 1100 years while ejecting their stellar winds, thus providing various descriptions of the hot shocked gas around Sgr A*. In this work, we perform 3D X-ray radiative transfer calculations on these hydrodynamic simulations with the goal of reproducing the Chandra observations in the central ±6"" around Sgr A*. The model spectral shape from the 2""-5"" ring agrees very well with the observations for all feedback models, and the X-ray flux levels of the no or weak feedback models agree with the observation for r<~3"". The model flux is too low beyond this radius, while the strong feedback models produce too low a flux throughout the entire simulation region. This is because the strong outflow emanating from the SMBH clears out much of the hot, X-ray emitting gas from its vicinity.  These strong feedback simulations are thus excluded from describing Sgr A*. We will conclude by discussing ways to improve the no and weak feedback models, such as by including the O stars and their winds, which should cause the WR-wind X-ray emission to increase as these adiabatic shocks (whose strength is inversely proportional to the distance to the shock) will occur closer to their WR stars.\n",1,

It is the closest SMBH and thus an ideal target for investigation of galactic nuclei and their activity cycles. This goal can be fulfilled by studying its current, past and possible future outbursts. Its current X-ray quiescent state, with a luminosity of L<sub>X</sub> ~ 10<sup>33</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>, is punctuated by X-ray flares up to a few times 10<sup>35</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>, whose origin is poorly understood. With 638.6 ks NuSTAR observation of Sgr A*, I collected nine X-ray flares which are detected up to 79 keV, and studied their timing behavior using the Bayesian block analysis. The broadband (3-79 keV) spectroscopic studies show that the X-ray flares can have a range of photon indexes, which can be explained by the magnetic reconnection scenario. During the flares, Sgr A* is still orders of magnitudes lower than its Eddington luminosity. Whether it has ever experienced more substantial increases in activity as observed in low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei is still under discussion. Indication of such past activity of Sgr A* has come from the Galactic center molecular clouds (GCMCs). I use the hard X-ray emission from Sgr B2, the densest GCMC, to constrain the past Sgr A* X-ray outburst, resulting in L<sub>X</sub>~5×10<sup>38</sup> erg s<sup>-1 </sup>with a photon index of Γ=2.2±0.4. I also discovered different timing variability from different cloud substructures, which can further constrain the past Sgr A* outburst and the cloud structure. Future giant outburst from Sgr A* could be triggered by dust/gas infall. Although the G2 infall event has not caused any increased X-ray activity from Sgr A*, there has been evidence that it caused flare behavior changes. Ongoing hard X-ray monitoring of Sgr A* will address this remaining puzzle.\n",2,

Recent studies have suggested that the star formation relations in this region are anomalous, with less star formation per unit dense (n > 10^4 cm^-3) gas than is seen elsewhere in the universe. While this would be an exciting result indicating that star formation may proceed differently as a function of environment, it must be verified that it is not an effect of either undercounting the amount of star formation, or overestimating the bulk gas density in this region. CMZ gas densities in particular have not been revisited in several decades, and have only been measured accurately for a small handful of clouds in this region. We address this deficiency by presenting updated gas densities for a sample of 10 of the most massive molecular clouds in the CMZ. We use the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, MOPRA, and APEX to measure lines of HC3N from J = 3-2 to J=30-29, and then perform radiative transfer analysis to constrain gas densities. We find that typical gas densities are somewhat lower than previously indicated, and present the first constraints on the fraction of gas with n >10^5 cm^-3 for multiple clouds in this region.\n",5,

Analyses on the line strengths in individual or small samples of sight lines (< 30) imply plasma densities between 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, but the dominant hot gas structure is argued to be either a disk morphology (~10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> of material) or a spherical morphology (10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> of material). This is a crucial distinction since these morphologies arise from significantly different galaxy evolution processes, and the Fermi bubbles are recently discovered objects that are interacting with the ambient CGM. In this dissertation, I constrain the global hot gas density structure by comparing the largest samples of OVII equivalent width measurements and OVII-OVIII line intensities with model line strengths from parametric density models. I find that a spherical profile with n ∝ r<sup>-3/2</sup> extending to the Milky Way's virial radius results in model line strenghts that are most consistent with how the observed line strengths vary across the sky. These results imply a hot gas mass between 2-5 x 10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> within 250 kpc (≤ 50% of the Galactic missing baryons), a hot gas metallicity of Z ≥ .3 Z<sub>⊙</sub>, and that most of the hot gas formed as shock-heated material during the Milky Way's formation. For the Fermi bubbles, the line intensities and ratios suggest they contain hotter gas than the surrounding medium (> 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> K) and densities between 10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. This implies the bubbles are over-pressurized and expanding into the surrounding halo, potentially heating and displacing the ambient CGM.\n",6,

Benjamin*,Sessioned,"Univ. of Wisconsin,Whitewater","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Scutum-Centaurus Spiral Arm, sometimes referred to as the ""Molecular Ring”, is one of the most prominent star-forming structures in the Milky Way Galaxy. The arm extends from a Galactic longitude of L=+30 degrees to L=–50 (310) degrees, and then behind Galactic center to become the Outer Scutum-Centaurus Arm. It is characterized by long, filamentary dark clouds, concentrated star formation, and numerous supernova remnants and bubbles. Previous models have shown that the energy input of supernova explosions can drive a “hybrid” thermal pressure/cosmic-ray pressure wind out of the Galaxy from this region and that such a wind can explain both the 3/4 keV X-ray emission observed by ROSAT as well as the high-latitude 408 MHz radio synchrotron emisison. Here the effects of Galactic rotation on this wind are demonstrated. The morphology of the X-ray and synchrotron emission as well as the behavior of the Ophiuchus superbubble (which is part of this flow) are shown to be consistent with a launching, rotating wind.  Predictions for the velocity structure of this gas are provided that can be tested with future emission and absorption line studies. The importance of understanding this wind as a foreground in studies of the “Fermi Bubble” is also discussed.\n",7,

Hallinan*,G. Hallinan*,Sessioned,California Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): At the start of this decade, the Very Large Array underwent a transformative upgrade. While retaining its original 27 antennas, the signal transmission and processing systems, originally developed and built in the 1970s, have been replaced with state of the art wideband receivers and a new data transmission system, as well as one of the most powerful correlators yet built. With a ten-fold increase in continuum sensitivity, up to 4 million frequency channels and complete frequency coverage from 1-50 GHz, the resulting increase in capability and versatility is analogous to the transition from photographic plate to CCD technology that revolutionized optical astronomy in the 1980s. Post upgrade, the Jansky VLA will be the most sensitive radio interferometer in the world for this decade, probing the sub-uJy radio sky for the first time, and will remain the most versatile, frequency-agile radio telescope for the foreseeable future. Underscoring this versatility, is the VLA's capability to trace both thermal and non-thermal emission over a wide range of spatial, time and velocity resolution. At the highest frequencies, this includes imaging cool gas in high redshift galaxies and dusty disks in nearby protoplanetary systems, while at the lowest frequencies tracing AGN activity and star formation back to the epoch of reionization. In the time domain, the VLA can respond to external triggers within 15 minutes to provide an instantaneous broadband radio spectrum of explosive events. I will review some of the exciting science emerging from the Jansky VLA as well as the range of science-ready data products that will make the VLA increasingly accessible to the wider astronomical community. Finally, I will briefly introduce the new VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), a community-driven project to image 80% of the sky over multiple epochs with the VLA, reaching a depth of ~70 uJy and detecting ~10 million radio sources at high spatial and spectral resolution with full polarization information.\n",1,

Roustazadeh*,P. Roustazadeh*; S. E. Thrush; M.

Gamma-gamma absorption and pair production leads to the development of pair cascades which will be deflected and partially isotropised by magnetic fields in the nuclear environment. This has been suggested to make a significant contribution to the Fermi gamma-ray emission of radio galaxies. In this work, we present the study of the time dependence of these cascades, demonstrating that they can be variable on time scales much shorter than the light-crossing time through the characteristic extent of the circumnuclear radiation field. Thus, this interpretation is still consistent with the Fermi gamma-ray emission of radio galaxies such as NGC 1275, even considering the recently observed short-term variability.\n",1,

Expanding on the work of Biteau & Williams 2015, we develop a novel natural cubic spline model of the local EBL spectrum and constrain its parameters using the gamma-ray spectra of 38 blazars measured in the high-energy (HE, 0.1 to 100 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, 0.1 to 20 TeV) bands. Starting from this best-fit model, we then study the so-called “delta gamma” (ΔΓ) observable, defined as the difference between the VHE and HE photon indices. This second study is focused on a subset of nine BL Lac objects. The application of a scaling factor to the cosmic optical background (0.1 - 10 nm) significantly impacts the predicted ΔΓ as a function of redshift, whereas a similar modification of the cosmic infrared background (10 - 1000 nm) has no impact. We conclude that the simple delta gamma approach can only constrain part of the EBL spectrum, while a detailed study of the spectra, such as presented in the first part of this research, is needed to constrain the cosmic infrared background.\n",2,

The distinguishing feature of our model is that X-ray coronal gas is, for the first time, an integral part of the inflow gas and its observable characteristics are physically coupled to the concomitant inflow gas. One natural prediction of our model is the anti-correlation between accretion disk luminosity and spectral hardness: as the luminosity of SMBH accretion disk decreases, the hard X-ray luminosity increases relative to the UV/optical luminosity.\n",3,

As our sources are individually detected in the SPIRE bands, they are bright in the FIR, exhibiting typical star formation rates (SFRs) of order of 1000 M<sub>⊙</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup>. We find the SFR to increase by a factor of nearly ten from <i>z</i>~0.5 to <i>z~</i>3, in line with the increasing comoving SFR density over a similar redshift range. The SFR, however, is shown to remain constant with increasing quasar luminosity for quasars with IR luminosities above 10<sup>12</sup>L<sub>⊙,</sub> indicating a self-regulating star formation process rather than a suppression effect due to the presence of powerful AGN.

We find the accretion luminosities and λ<sub>Edd</sub> values of BAL quasars to be drawn from the same population as those of the non-BAL quasars; further, the host SFRs are statistically similar among the two populations, all of which argue against feedback effects. These similarities also oppose an evolutionary scenario, as a different evolutionary stage would imply differences in either the accretion state, the star formation, or both. Thus, to explain the presence of BALs in the spectra of a random fraction of the quasar population, our results favor an orientation effect.\n",4,

At higher redshifts, the more problematic C III] and C IV lines are the strongest emission lines. We compare several ultraviolet-based redshifts to [O III] redshifts from the near-infrared spectra of 40 quasars with z > 2.2, and find the UV-based measurements less than ideal.

Observations of the dynamics of stars and gas in the nuclear regions of nearby galaxies suggest that the majority of spheroidal galaxies in the local Universe contain massive BHs and that the masses of those central BH correlate with the velocity dispersions of the stars in the spheroid and the bulge luminosity. Cold ISM is the basic fuel for star-formation and BH growth so its study is essential to understanding how galaxies evolve.<br /><br />I will present high sensitivity observations taken with the Herschel Space Observatory to measure the cold dust content in a sample of 85 nearby (z <= 0.5) QSOs chosen from the optically luminous broad-line PG QSOs sample (QSO1s) and in a complementary sample of 85 narrow-line QSOs (QSO2s) chosen to match the redshift and optical luminosity distribution of the broad-line targets. The FIR data are combined with NIR and MIR measurements from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer to determine their IR spectral energy distributions which we use to assess and compare the aggregate dust properties of QSO1s and QSO2s. I will also present NIR spectroscopy obtained with Gemini's Near-Infrared Spectrograph of a sub-sample of QSO2s and QSO1s which I use to compare the ratio of cold to warm H2 gas that emits in the NIR in the hosts of QSO1s and QSO2s.<br /><br />Finally I will present a comparison of star-formation in QSO1s and QSO2s. For both QSO1s and QSO2s 3stimates of star-formation rates that are based on the total IR continuum emission correlate with those based on the 11.3 micron PAH feature. However, for the QSO1s, star-formation rates estimated from the FIR continuum are higher than those estimated from the 11.3 micron PAH emission. This result can be attributed to a variety of factors including the possible destruction of the PAHs and that, in some sources, a fraction of the FIR originates from dust heated by the active galactic nucleus and by old stars. For QSO2s the SFR derived from the 11.3 micron PAH feature match those derived from the 160micron emission.<br />\n",7,

However, to maintain a steady jet, a stable shock location is required. By employing the Chevalier & Imamura linearization method and the Nakayama instability boundary conditions, we have also shown that there is a region of the energy and angular momentum parameter space in which disk/shocks with outflows can be either stable or unstable. In a region of instability, the velocity profiles that exhibit pre-shock deceleration and pre-shock acceleration are always unstable to the zeroth mode with zero frequency of oscillation. However, in a region of stability, the zeroth mode, the fundamental, and the overtones are all stable for both pre-shock deceleration as well as pre-shock acceleration.

So far, the most promising theory for the origin of subdwarf B (sdB) stars is that they result from binary mass transfer near the Helium Flush stage. We attempted to constrain this evolutional theory by searching for companions and determining periods and orbital separations around sdB pulsators using the Observed-minus-Calculated (O-C) method. A star’s position in space will wobble due to the gravitational forces of any companion. If the star is emitting a periodic signal, its orbital motion around the system’s center of mass causes periodic changes in the light pulse arrival times. EC 20117-4014 was monitored from 2010-1 using the 0.6m SARA-CT telescope in Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, Chile.

The sample size has been enlarged over the past six years by observations made using telescopes in the SARA consortium at KPNO and CTIO. Periods have been determined for those of F-G spectral types. We have also enlarged the sample with PPNe from outside the Milky Way by determining periods of eight PPNe in the lower metalicity environment of the Magellanic Clouds. Periods for the entire sample range from 35 to 160 days. Some clear patterns have emerged, with those of higher temperature possessing shorter periods and smaller amplitudes, indicating a reduction in period and pulsation amplitude as the objects evolve.

Lu,Sessioned,Valparaiso University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): In the course of long-term photometric monitoring of post-AGB stars at the Valparaiso University campus observatory, we have also observed some objects of uncertain evolutionary state. This includes two objects that have some of the characteristics of post-AGB stars, such as large IR excesses and F-G spectral types. The weight of recent evidence suggests that two of these, IRAS 19114+0002 (AFGL 2343) and IRAS 19244+1115 (IRC+10 420), are instead hypergiants, objects of very high luminosity arising from evolved high-mass progenitors. A third object, IRAS 20004+2955 (V1027 Cyg), appears to be a cool post-AGB star evolving from a low or intermediate-mass progenitor. We have light and color curves from 1994-2007, along with some radial velocity data from 1991-1995. These three objects display complex light and color curves with evidence of periodicity in the range of 100 to 300 days. We will present the results of these studies.

The tidal response of the star can be calculated by solving a revised stellar oscillations equations.<br /><br />The open-source stellar oscillation code GYRE (Townsend & Teitler 2013) can be used to solve the free stellar oscillation equations in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic cases. It uses a novel matrix exponential method which avoids many difficulties of the classical shooting and relaxation method. The new version also includes the effect of rotation in traditional approximation.<br /><br />After showing the code flow of GYRE, we revise its subroutines and extend its capability to calculate tidally<br />forced oscillations in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic cases following the procedure in the CAFein code (Valsecchi et al. 2013).

E. Jones*,D. E. Jones*; Y. Chen; X. Meng; A. Siemiginowska; V. Kashyap,Sessioned,"Harvard University; Harvard Smithsonian, CfA","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Since telescope time is limited, real-time lightcurve classification involves carefully selecting future time points at which sources must be observed in order to maximize the information that will be gained for classification. We propose a framework for constructing measures of information for testing/classification/model-selection and demonstrate their use in experimental design. Degroot (1962) developed a general framework for constructing Bayesian measures of the expected information that an experiment will provide for estimation, and our framework analogously constructs measures of information for hypothesis testing. Such test information measures are most useful for model selection and classification problems. Indeed, our framework suggests a probability based measure of test information, which in decision problems has more appealing properties than variance based measures. In the case of lightcurve classification, we adapt our designs to penalize long waits until the next observation time. Lastly, we consider ways to address other aspects of the problem, such as uncertainty estimation arising due to contamination from nearby contaminating sources or background diffuse emission.

WWT was motivated by the desire to put new surveys of objects, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the context of the night sky. The development of WWT under Microsoft started with the creation of a Windows desktop client that is widely used in various education, outreach and research projects. Using this, users can explore the data built into WWT as well as data that is loaded in. Beyond exploration, WWT can be used to create tours that present various datasets a narrative format.<br />In the past two years, the team developed a collection of web controls, including an HTML5 web client, which contains much of the functionality of the Windows desktop client. The project under Microsoft has deep connections with several user communities such as education through the WWT Ambassadors program, http://wwtambassadors.org/ and with planetariums and museums such as the Adler Planetarium. WWT can also support research, including using WWT to visualize the Bones of the Milky Way and rich connections between WWT and the Astrophysical Data Systems (ADS, http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/). One important new research connection is the use of WWT to create dynamic and potentially interactive supplements to journal articles, which have been created in 2015.<br />Now WWT is an open source community lead project. The source code is available in GitHub (https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope). There is significant developer documentation on the website (http://worldwidetelescope.org/Developers/) and an extensive developer workshops (http://wwtworkshops.org/?tribe_events=wwt-developer-workshop) has taken place in the fall of 2015.<br />Now that WWT is open source anyone who has the interest in the project can be a contributor.

Jo*,Y. Jo*; H. Lee; V. Mikhailenko; V. Mikhailenko,Sessioned,Pusan National University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): It was derived that the drift-Alfven instabilities with the shear flow parallel to the magnetic field have significant difference from the drift-Alfven instabilities of a shearless plasma when the ion temperature is comparable with electron temperature for a finite plasma beta. The velocity shear not only modifies the frequency and the growth rate of the known drift-Alfven instability, which develops due to the inverse electron Landau damping, but also triggers a combined effect of the velocity shear and the inverse ion Landau damping, which manifests the development of the ion kinetic shear-flow-driven drift-Alfven instability. The excited unstable waves have the phase velocities along the magnetic field comparable with the ion thermal velocity, and the growth rate is comparable with the frequency. The development of this instability may be the efficient mechanism of the ion energization in shear flows. The levels of the drift--Alfven turbulence, resulted from the development of both instabilities, are determined from the renormalized nonlinear dispersion equation, which accounts for the nonlinear effect of the scattering of ions by the electromagnetic turbulence. The renormalized quasilinear equation for the ion distribution function, which accounts for the same effect of the scattering of ions by electromagnetic turbulence, is derived and employed for the analysis of the ion viscosity and ions heating, resulted from the interactions of ions with drift-Alfven turbulence. In the same way, the phenomena of the ion cyclotron turbulence and anomalous anisotropic heating of ions by ion cyclotron plasma turbulence has numerous practical applications in physics of the near-Earth space plasmas. Using the methodology of the shearing modes, the kinetic theory of the ion cyclotron turbulence of the plasma with transverse current with strong velocity shear has been developed.<br />\n",7,

This is by far the largest sample ever used to study quasar clustering at ""intermediate"" redshifts. We ameliorate the effect of observational systematics on our clustering analyses by weighting our control catalogues of random points by maps of how observational systematics correlate with the BOSS quasar target density. We find that there is no significant evolution in the quasar correlation length and bias over our studied redshift range, implying that the masses of the dark matter halos that host quasars decreases slightly from z~2.2 to z~3.4. Our result also contradicts a monotonic relation between the optical luminosity of quasars near redshift 2.5 and their host halo masses. To begin to study whether this contradiction holds for quasars' bolometric luminosity, we use data from the Wide-field Infra red Survey Explorer (WISE) to study whether the luminosity or detection of BOSS quasars in the mid-IR is correlated with the masses of quasars' host halos.

In the paper, ""The Mystery of the Cosmic Diffuse Ultraviolet Background Radiation,"" by Richard Conn Henry, Jayant Murthy, James Overduin, Joshua Tyler, ApJ, 798:14 (25pp), 2015 January 1, we demonstrated the existence of a <i>second component</i> of the diffuse far ultraviolet background radiation beyond that provided by dust-scattered starlight. The critical question is, does that second component (of unknown origin) extend shortward of the Lyman limit of 912 Å? If it does, then it seems likely that we have discovered the source of the reionization of the Universe that occurred some time after recombination. As things stand at the moment, there is no known source that has been demonstrated to be capable of performing the reionization: reionization that clearly did occur. Our current understanding of P-Alice suggests that it may well be capable of demonstrating the presence (or absence) of such ionizing cosmic diffuse radiation. At low Galactic latitudes, all such radiation would be totally erased by the presence, in large quantities, of interstellar neutral hydrogen; this will allow us to test the reality of any such flux that we may discover at higher Galactic latitudes.\n",2,

Mountain,Sessioned,STScI,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields program is a large Director's Discretionary program of 840 orbits, to obtain ultra-deep observations of six strong lensing clusters of galaxies, together with parallel deep blank fields, making use of the strong lensing amplification by these clusters of distant background galaxies to detect the faintest galaxies currently observable in the high-redshift universe. The first four of these clusters are now complete, namely Abell 2744, MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J0717.5+3745 and MACS J1149.5+2223, with each of these having been observed over two epochs, to a total depth of 140 orbits on the main cluster and an associated parallel field, using ACS (F435W, F606W, F814W) and WFC3/IR (F105W, F125W, F140W, F160W). The remaining two clusters, Abell 370 and Abell S1063, are currently in progress. Full sets of high-level science products have been generated for all these clusters by the team at STScI, including a total of 24 separate cumulative-depth data releases during each epoch, as well as full-depth version 1.0 releases at the end of each completed epoch. These products include all the full-depth distortion-corrected mosaics and associated products for each cluster, which are science-ready to facilitate the construction of lensing models as well as enabling a wide range of other science projects. Many improvements beyond default calibration for ACS and WFC3/IR are implemented in these data products, including corrections for persistence, time-variable sky, and low-level dark current residuals, as well as improvements in astrometric alignment to achieve milliarcsecond-level accuracy. The resulting high-level science products are delivered via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) to the community on a rapid timescale to enable the widest scientific use of these data, as well as ensuring a public legacy dataset of the highest possible quality that is of lasting value to the entire community.\n",3,

I am leading the effort to detect spatial fluctuations of the 21 cm transition from the cosmic dawn (z~20) with the OVRO LWA. These spatial fluctuations are primarily sourced by inhomogeneous X-ray heating from early star formation. The spectral hardness of early X-ray sources, stellar feedback mechanisms, and baryon streaming therefore all play a role in shaping the power spectrum. I will present the application of m-mode analysis (Shaw et al. 2014, Shaw et al. 2015) to OVRO LWA data to: 1. compress the data set, 2. create maps of the northern sky that can be fed back into the calibration pipeline, and 3. filter foreground emission. Finally I will present the current status and future prospects of the OVRO LWA for detecting the 21 cm power spectrum at z~20.\n",4,

Zhao*,X. Zhao*; Y. Li; Q. Zhu; D. B. Fox,Sessioned,Pennsylvania State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): According to the second law of thermodynamics, the arrow of time points to an ever increasing entropy of the Universe. However, exactly how the entropy evolves with time and what drives the growth remain largely unknown. Here, for the first time, we quantify the evolving entropy of cosmic structures using a large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Our simulation starts from initial conditions predicted by the leading LambdaCDM cosmology, self-consistently evolves the dynamics of both dark and baryonic matter, star formation, black hole growth and feedback processes, from the cosmic dawn to the present day. Tracing the entropy contributions of these distinct components in the simulation, we find a strong link between entropy growth and structure formation. The entropy is dominated by that of the black holes in all epochs, and its evolution follows the same path as that of galaxies: it increases rapidly from a low-entropy state at high redshift until z~2, then transits to a slower growth. Our results suggest that cosmic entropy may co-evolve with cosmic structure, and that its growth may be driven mainly by the formation of black holes in galaxies. We predict that the entropy will continue to increase in the near future, but likely at a constant rate.\n",6,

Andrews*,H. Andrews*,Sessioned,Vanderbilt University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We study the environmental dependence of the galaxy luminosity function in the ECO survey and compare it with models that associate galaxies with dark matter halos. Specifically, we quantify the environment of each galaxy in the ECO survey using an Nth nearest neighbor distance metric, and we measure how the galaxy luminosity distribution varies from low density to high density environments. As expected, we find that luminous galaxies preferentially populate high density regions, while low luminosity galaxies preferentially populate lower density environments. We investigate whether this trend can be explained simply by the correlation of galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass combined with the environmental dependence of the halo mass function. In other words, we test the hypothesis that the luminosity of a galaxy depends solely on the mass of its dark matter halo and does not exhibit a residual dependence on the halo’s larger environment. To test this hypothesis, we first construct mock ECO catalogs by populating dark matter halos in an N-body simulation with galaxies using a model that preserves the overall clustering strength of the galaxy population. We then assign luminosities to the mock galaxies using physically motivated models that connect luminosity to halo mass and are constrained to match the global ECO luminosity function. Finally, we impose the radial and angular selection functions of the ECO survey and repeat our environmental analysis on the mock catalogs. Though our mock catalog luminosity functions display similar qualitative trends as those from the ECO data, the trends are not in agreement quantitatively. Our results thus suggest that the simple models used to build the mocks are incomplete and that galaxy luminosity is possibly correlated with the larger scale density field.\n",7,

Over the four years of activity, over 25,000 people have received programming. The effort has trained nature educators, permanent and seasonal AMC staff, and undergraduate physics and astronomy students to integrate diverse topical material and deliver high quality programming to the lay public. Unique to the program is the holistic nature of the material delivered - an 'atypical' astronomy program. Linking observable characteristics of the natural world with astronomical history and phenomena, and emphasizing the unique sequence of events that have led to human life on Earth, the program has changed attitudes and behaviors among the public participants. Successful interventions have included hands-on observing programs (day and night) that link nature content to the observed objects; table-talk presentations on nature/astronomy topics; dark skies preservation workshops; and hands-on activities developed for younger audiences, including schools, camps, and family groups. An extensive evaluation and assessment effort managed by a leading sociologist has demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach, and contributed to continuous improvement in the program content and methods.

F. Albin*,E. F. Albin*,Sessioned,Fernbank Science Center,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): As the planetarium approaches its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary, today’s planetarium educator must reflect on the role of such technology in contemporary astronomy education and outreach.  The projection planetarium saw ""first light"" in 1923 at the Carl Zeiss factory in Jena, Germany.  During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the concept of a star projector beneath a dome flourished as an extraordinary device for the teaching of astronomy.  The evolution of digital technology over the past twenty years has dramatically changed the perception / utilization of the planetarium.  The vast majority of modern star theaters have shifted entirely to fulldome digital projection systems, abandoning the once ubiquitous electromechanical star projector altogether.  These systems have evolved into ultra-high resolution theaters, capable of projecting imagery, videos, and any web-based media onto the dome.  Such capability has rendered the planetarium as a multi-disciplinary tool, broadening its educational appeal to a wide variety of fields -- including life sciences, the humanities, and even entertainment venues. However, we suggest that what is at the heart of the planetarium appeal is having a theater adept at projecting a beautiful / accurate star-field.  To this end, our facility chose to keep / maintain its aging Zeiss V star projector while adding fulldome digital capability.  Such a hybrid approach provides an excellent compromise between presenting state of the art multimedia while at the same time maintaining the ability to render a stunning night sky. In addition, our facility maintains two portable StarLab planetariums for outreach purposes, one unit with a classic electromechanical star projector and the other having a relatively inexpensive fulldome projection system.  With a combination of these technologies, it is possible for the planetarium to be an effective tool for astronomical education / outreach well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.\n",3,

Although MOOCs resemble more formal classes (e.g. videos of content, quizzes, activities), they are often used by informal audiences from home. Recently, MOOCs have become more utilized by universities to conduct outreach as they explore how to use MOOCs to reach new potential learners. Despite the rapid adaption of MOOCs, little is known about individuals who choose to take a MOOC, how they interact with the course materials, and what motivates them to finish the course.<br /><br />We present results of a study of lifelong learners engaged in an astronomy ""101"" MOOC. Through analysis of registered learners’ behaviors as well as self-reported responses to a survey about science, we were able to characterize a subset of the learners engaged in the MOOC during its first offering. Overall, 25363 learners from over 100 countries registered for the MOOC. Of those, 14900 accessed at least one part of the course. Learners were recruited to complete a survey of their knowledge and attitudes towards science. Of the learner group who opened the course, 2889 individuals completed the survey, 2465 of those were able to be linked to their usage of the MOOC through a unique identifier.<br /><br />Learners represented a wide-range of ages, professions, and previous science experience. The best predictors for MOOC completion were engagement in the first activity and first writing assignment and engagement in the online forum. Learners were very interested in science prior to their registration, had higher basic science knowledge that most undergraduate students enrolled in a parallel astronomy course, and used online searches and science sites to get their information about science. As we reach out to a worldwide audience to learners in these massively open online courses, understanding their motivations and behaviors will be essential. This work is helping us understand and characterize lifelong learners who are interested in engaging in these types of free-choice learning environments and better serve their needs.\n",6,

Kaur*,A. Kaur*; D. Hartmann,Sessioned,Clemson University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Observations of novae in M31 reveal more novae in the bulge as compared to the disk, suggesting that perhaps the bulge population is a more prolific nova producer than the disk, but the theoretical modeling of evolution of the underlying progenitor binary systems by Yungelson et al. 1997 suggests otherwise. This discrepancy has not yet been resolved. In order to understand the intrinsic bulge to disk nova rate in M31, we consider the role of dust in the disk of M31. To model extinction in M31 we construct a three component dust distribution model for the disk, and assume a dust-free bulge. This model is based on the 160 μm image of Gordon et al. 2006, which traces the bulk of the dust mass in M31. The model combines a ring at R = 10 kpc, two spiral arms and a smooth background (uniform disk) with a central hole extending to 3 kpc. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the extinction effects of the dust on spatial distribution models of novae, and investigate whether the observed bulge/disk ratio can be accomplished for reasonable choices of parameters, or if the population synthesis of nova progenitors requires modifications.<br />\n",2,

In 1976, Rust, Leventhal and McCall [<i>Nature</i>, <b>262</b>, 118-120] used sums of exponentials fitting to confirm the acceleration hypothesis, but their result was nevertheless rejected by the astronomical community. Here, we model Type Ia light curves with a system of ODEs (describing the nuclear decays) forced by a Ni-deposition pulse modelled by a 3-parameter Weibull pdf, with all of this occuring in the center of a pre-existing, optically thick, spherical shell which thermalizes the emitted gamma rays. Fitting this model to observed light curves routinely gives fits which account for 99.9+% of the total variance in the observed record. The accelerated decay rates are so stable, for such a long time, that they must occur in an almost unchanging environment -- not it a turbulent expanding atmosphere. The amplitude of the Ni-deposition pulse indicates that its source is the fusion of hydrogen. Carbon and oxygen could not supply the large energy/nucleon that is observed. The secondary peak in the infrared light curve can be easily modelled as a light echo from dust in the back side of the pre-existing shell, and the separation between the peaks indicates a radius of ≈15 light days for the shell. The long-term stability of the acceleration suggests that it is a kinematic effect arising because the nuclear reactions occur either on the surface of a very rapidly rotating condensed object, or in a very tight orbit around such an object, like the fusion pulse in a tokomak reactor.\n",4,

It is remarkable that all of these companion bodies are much redder in the visible region than their primary bodies. Storrs et al. (2009, BAAS vol. 41, no. 4, p 189) attributed this to space weathering, however, all of these bodies belong to dark C- or X-type groups. Current modeling of space weathering effects are limited to bright asteroids (e.g. Cloutis et al., Icarus 252, pp. 39-82, 2015) and show little change on the scale reported here. We suggest that the interaction of dark, possibly organic-rich surfaces with the solar wind produces reddening on a much greater scale than is observed in bright, silica-rich surfaces, and that this effect is easily reset by collisions. Thus, while both the parent and companion object accumulate the effects, the parent is much more likely to be ""reset"" by small collisions than the companion, due to the differences in their cross-sections.\n",1,

The Rayleigh distribution is zero for negative values, and follows f(x) = x exp[-x<sup>2</sup>/(2σ<sup>2</sup>)]/σ<sup>2 </sup>for positive x.

Shi*,Sessioned,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): NASA’s WFIRST-AFTA Coronagraph will be capable of directly imaging and spectrally characterizing giant exoplanets similar to Neptune and Jupiter, and possibly even super-Earths, around nearby stars. To maintain the required coronagraph performance in a realistic space environment, a Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem is necessary. The LOWFS/C will use the rejected stellar light to sense and suppress the telescope pointing drift and jitter as well as low order wavefront errors due to the changes in thermal loading of the telescope and the rest of the observatory.  The measured wavefront information will also be used for the coronagraph data post-processing (PSF subtraction) needed to further remove the speckle field and enhance the contrast. The LOWFS/C uses a Zernike phase contrast wavefront sensor with the phase shifting disk combined with the stellar light rejecting occulting mask, a key concept to minimize the non-common path error. Developed as a part of the Dynamic High Contrast Imaging Testbed (DHCIT), the LOWFS/C subsystem also consists of an Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) simulator to generate the realistic wavefront error and line-of-sight (LoS) drift and jitter from WFIRST-AFTA telescope’s vibration and thermal drift. The entire LOWFS/C subsystem have been integrated, calibrated, and tested in a dedicated LOWFS/C testbed. The test results have shown that the Zernike WFS have line-of-sight (LoS) tilt sensitivity better than 0.2 milli-arcsec and LoS post correct residual better than 0.5 milli-arcsec with the presence of the WFIRST-AFTA like LoS drift and jitter (14 milli-arcsec).

A. Caceres*,G. A. Caceres*; E. Feigelson,Sessioned,Pennsylvania State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Kepler AutoRegressive Planet Search (KARPS) project uses statistical methodology associated with autoregressive (AR) processes to model Kepler lightcurves in order to improve exoplanet transit detection in systems with high stellar variability. We also introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect transits in time-series residuals after application of the AR models. One of the main obstacles in detecting faint planetary transits is the intrinsic stellar variability of the host star. The variability displayed by many stars may have autoregressive properties, wherein later flux values are correlated with previous ones in some manner. Our analysis procedure consisting of three steps: pre-processing of the data to remove discontinuities, gaps and outliers; AR-type model selection and fitting; and transit signal search of the residuals using a new Transit Comb Filter (TCF) that replaces traditional box-finding algorithms. The analysis procedures of the project are applied to a portion of the publicly available Kepler light curve data for the full 4-year mission duration. Tests of the methods have been made on a subset of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) systems, classified both as planetary `candidates' and `false positives' by the Kepler Team, as well as a random sample of unclassified systems. We find that the ARMA-type modeling successfully reduces the stellar variability, by a factor of 10 or more in active stars and by smaller factors in more quiescent stars. A typical quiescent Kepler star has an interquartile range (IQR) of ~10 e-/sec, which may improve slightly after modeling, while those with IQR ranging from 20 to 50 e-/sec, have improvements from 20% up to 70%. High activity stars (IQR exceeding 100) markedly improve. A periodogram based on the TCF is constructed to concentrate the signal of these periodic spikes. When a periodic transit is found, the model is displayed on a standard period-folded averaged light curve. Our findings to date on real-data tests of the KARPS methodology will be discussed including confirmation of some Kepler Team `candidate' planets. We also present cases of new possible planetary signals.\n",5,

This revolutionary mission will enable the direct detection of known and newly discovered exoplanets amongst the nearest stars, from super-Earths to giants. However, at this contrast the coronagraph will essentially see a Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in every image. For targets near the Galactic Plane on the sky, distant stars with varying levels of extinction and reddening will dominate the background. Away from the plane, we then expect extragalactic sources to dominate. What impact will these background sources have on the WFIRST exoplanet imaging program? How can we efficiently distinguish background sources from exoplanet targets in a single image? To have a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of background sources across the sky, we have used the HUDF to model extragalactic faint sources, and “Trilegal” simulations to model galactic background sources. Through some preliminary color and point source analysis, we offer a statistical estimation of expected background contamination and the probability of false positive background sources. In this poster we show plots relating number of extragalactic sources versus magnitude in HUDF and “Trilegal” simulation. We present a table of high priority WFIRST exoplanet imaging targets, with an assessment of the “background threat” due to background stars, galaxies, and binary companions.\n",6,

Notably absent from planet occurrence calculations are single planet mid-type M dwarfs (~M2-M6).

Over the past decades, the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation has been decreased significantly by accurate photometric measures in the NIR bands. However, the small measurement errors on total luminosity can no longer explain the observed scatter. Therefore, we abandon the classical concept of the Tully-Fisher relation as a correlation using the width of global HI profile and consider instead the internal kinematics of gas in galaxies.<br />As it is still not clear at which wavelengths the smallest scatter in the relation can be achieved, we assemble the Tully-Fisher relation for a calibrator sample of galaxies with measured TRGB/Cepheid distances over the broad wavelength range from FUV to 22 mm. We implement an improved kinematic measure by deriving high quality rotation curves, taking into account warps and streaming motions in the disk due to spiral arms or a bar.<br />As a result, our studies show that besides the wavelength dependence, statistical properties of the Tully-Fisher relation are highly sensitive to the internal kinematics of gas.\n",3,

Dunn*,Sessioned,Midwestern State University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe, yet the driving forces in their evolution remain elusive. The proposed evolutionary link between dwarf irregular and dwarf elliptical/spheroidal galaxies is investigated using broad-band UBVR photometry obtained for a sample of 29 dwarf galaxies. The galaxies span a range of absolute B-band magnitude from -13.67 to -19.86 mag. Broad-band colors and Sérsic surface brightness profile fits are compared for the two morphological types. All optical parameters are statistically different between the two subsamples, as evidenced by the significance level of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.<br /><br />Others have noted that dwarf ellipticals might have looked much like the currently observed dwarf irregulars in the past based on optical colors. An overlap between in the range of colors observed is noted for these targets, implying the possibility of an evolutionary link. A difference is noted between the two samples in the value of n (the power-law exponent determined from the Sérsic profile fitting), suggesting that the two main types of dwarf galaxy are structurally distinct. The differences in the structure of the stellar components would imply that dwarf irregulars do not evolve to become dwarf ellipticals in isolation, meaning that some sort of external interaction is required if the transformation is to occur. However, when the brightest dwarf elliptical targets are eliminated from the comparison, the two dwarf samples are much more similar in their values and range for the power-law exponent, which again suggests a possible evolutionary link.

Chakrabarti*,S. Chakrabarti*,Sessioned,Rochester Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We present results from follow-up spectroscopic observations of clustered Cepheid candidates identified from <i>K</i>-band light curves towards the Norma constellation (Chakrabarti et al. 2015), as well as others that we have found more recently. The average radial velocity of these stars is ~ 200 km/s, which is large and distinct from that of the Galaxy’s stellar disk. These objects at <i>l ~</i> −27 and <i>b ~</i> −1 are therefore halo stars; using the period-luminosity relation of Type I Cepheids, they are at ~ 90 kpc. While the spectra do not have sufficient <i>S</i>/<i>N </i>to independently determine the metallicity and spectral type of the stars, there is a clear correspondence between the observed Brackett series lines in these observations and in known Type I Cepheids. Distances determined from the <i>K</i>-band period-luminosity relation (Matsunaga et al. 2013) and the 3.6 μm period-luminosity relation (Scowcroft et al. 2011) agree closely, and I-band observations have confirmed the periods of these sources. The extinction corrected <i>J </i>− <i>K</i><i>s </i>colors of these sources are comparable to known Type I Cepheids (Persson et al. 2004). The observed radial velocity of these stars agrees with predictions from dynamical models (Chakrabarti & Blitz 2009). If these stars are indeed members of the predicted dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxy that perturbed the outer HI disk of the Milky Way, this would represent the first application of Galactoseismology. These observations also challenge models of the Galactic halo. Young Cepheid variables are unexpected in models of the Galactic halo, though star formation due to infall of gas-rich dwarf galaxies may well produce a small population of yet undiscovered Cepheids in the outer halo.\n",6,

Prakash*,Sessioned,University of Pittsburgh,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): <br />SDSS-IV/eBOSS is producing an exciting data set for cosmology which will add to our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) component of this survey will cover a redshift regime barely explored by SDSS-III/BOSS and will allow a ∼1% measurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and a 4.0% Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurement using a relatively uniform set of luminous, early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.<br />    We briefly review a new technique of selecting high-z LRGs utilizing SDSS and WISE (infrared) photometry in combination. These galaxies are old, elliptical systems with strong 4000 °A breaks. Old stellar populations exhibit a global maximum in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at a wavelength of 1.6 μm, commonly referred to as the '1.6 μm bump'. Since LRGs possess very few young stars, this feature generally dominates their overall SEDs which makes them extremely bright in infrared. SDSS-IV/eBOSS LRGs range from redshift z  = 0.6 to 1.0 over 10,000 square degrees  of the sky. Here we briefly present the results of the 3D real space clustering power spectrum of a sample of 600,000 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using photometric redshifts. Although spectroscopic redshifts provide stronger constraints  on     large scale measurements, these results demonstrate the ability to make precise clustering measurements with photometric surveys.\n",1,

ESO137-G006 is located in the Norma Cluster, NGC 3309 is located in the Hydra Cluster, while NGC 5128, also known as Centaurus A, is a nearby galaxy with numerous other distance measurements, including Cepheids. These galaxies were observed as a pathfinder to establish the SBF technique using the MCAO system.<br />The J and K-band images taken with MCAO were astrometrically corrected and combined using the THELI software. This method allowed us to accurately account for the distortions of the focal plane when combining the images. The foreground stars as well as the globular clusters were measured to account for their contribution to the SBF. J-K color measurements were made to calibrate SBF and determine the stellar populations of the galaxies.<br />The results of these measurements give us an SBF calibration that we can use to measure the distances to much more distant galaxies. Accurate distances are needed to determine the true spatial motions of galaxies and measure the mass distribution and density of the Universe. We now live in the era of “precision cosmology” in which distance measurements have transformed our understanding of the composition of the Universe and revealed the presence of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the two dominant (but still unidentified) components of the Universe. The origins and nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy are among the most important unsolved mysteries in physics.\n",2,

A tantalizing large-scale correlation signal between the residual Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) and CIB found in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) further suggests that at least 20% of the CIB fluctuations are associated with accreting X-ray sources, with efficient energy production similar to black holes. However, there is still a controversy about the sources that produce the excess flux. They could be faint, local populations with different spatial distribution from other known galaxies, or high-z populations at the epoch of reionization that we know little of. Constraining the origin of the CIB fluctuations will help to establish our understanding of the overall cosmic energy budget. We will combine the archival Spitzer/IRAC and the Chandra data of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), to accurately measure the source-subtracted CIB and CXB fluctuations to the largest angular scale (~1-2 deg) to date. The newly discovered link between CIB and CXB fluctuations found in the EGS will be revisited in the COSMOS, which provides better photon statistics.

This cluster is the most massive galaxy cluster currently known at <i>z</i> > 1.5, based on existing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and gravitational lensing detections. We confirm this high mass via a variety of X-ray scaling relations, including T<sub>X</sub>–M, f<sub>g</sub>–M, Y<sub>X</sub>–M, and L<sub>X</sub>–M, finding a tight distribution of masses from these different methods, spanning M<sub>500</sub> = 2.3–3.3 x 10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, with the low-scatter Y<sub>X</sub>-based mass M<sub>500,Yx</sub> = 2.6<sup>+1.5</sup><sub>-0.5</sub> × 10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>. IDCS J1426.5+3508 is currently the only cluster at <i>z</i> > 1.5 for which X-ray, SZ and gravitational lensing mass estimates exist, and these are in remarkably good agreement. We find a relatively tight distribution of the gas-to-total mass ratio, employing total masses from all of the aforementioned indicators, with values ranging from f<sub>gas,500</sub> = 0.087–0.12. We do not detect metals in the intracluster medium (ICM) of this system, placing a 2σ upper limit of Z(r < R500) < 0.18 Z<sub>⊙</sub>. This upper limit on the metallicity suggests that this system may still be in the process of enriching its ICM. The cluster has a dense, low-entropy core, offset by ~30 kpc from the X-ray centroid, which makes it one of the few ""cool core"" clusters discovered at <i>z</i> > 1, and the first known cool core cluster at <i>z</i> > 1.2. The offset of this core from the large-scale centroid suggests that this cluster has had a relatively recent (500 Myr) merger/interaction with another massive system.\n",5,

Somboonpanyakul*,Sessioned,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The recent discovery of the “Phoenix cluster” which, at z = 0.6, is the most X-ray luminous clusters known and harbors a massive starburst at its center, begs the question: <i>Why was is not discovered until recently?</i> In fact, the object has been previously detected by several all-sky surveys at a variety of wavelengths, but it is consistently classified as a quasar (QSO) because of the extremely bright central galaxy and a (relative) lack of extended X-ray emission due to its distance. This lead us to question of how many of these Phoenix-like clusters are currently mislabelled in existing all-sky surveys.<br /><br />A unique property of the Phoenix cluster which helps us identify other Phoenix-like objects is that it is bright at multiple wavelength, including X-ray (intracluster medium and central AGN), near-IR (giant central elliptical galaxy), mid-IR (warm dust from starburst and AGN) and radio (radio-loud central AGN). Therefore, we can identify potential Phoenix-like clusters by cross-correlating all-sky surveys from <i>ROSAT</i> (X-ray), <i>2MASS</i> (near-IR), <i>WISE</i> (mid-IR) and both <i>SUMSS</i> and <i>NVSS</i> (radio). By requiring sources to be bright in all four surveys, we can quickly find (among other sources) a sample of Phoenix-like clusters that can be followed up either by using archival images from <i>SDSS</i> for Northern-hemisphere objects or taking new images from the <i>Magellan</i> telescope for Southern-hemisphere objects.

The damped Lyman-alpha absorbers [DLAs; log N(H I) >= 20.3] and the sub-DLA absorbers [19.0 <= log N(H I) < 20.3] dominate the neutral gas reservoir available for star formation. The super-DLAs [DLAs with log N(H I) >= 21.7] provide ideal laboratories to study the most gas-rich and potentially vigorously star-forming galaxies. We report a study of the DLAs (including super-DLAs) and sub-DLAs, based on observations from Keck, VLT, Magellan, and HST. We combine our results with the literature to examine trends between N(H I), metallicity, dust depletion, and gas velocity dispersion. We find that sub-DLAs have higher metallicities than DLAs at all redshifts studied, even after making ionization corrections. We find the super-DLAs have a relatively narrow range of metallicities. A much larger fraction of the super-DLAs lie close to or above the line [X/H] = 20.59 − log N(H I) in the metallicity versus N(H I) plot, compared to less gas-rich DLAs, suggesting that super-DLAs are more likely to be rich in molecules. Relative abundances of Si, S, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn suggest a mixture of dust depletion and alpha-enhancement. We confirm a strong correlation between metallicity and Fe depletion for DLAs, and also find a correlation between metallicity and Si depletion. For sub-DLAs at z < 0.5, we find [N/S] below the level for secondary N production. For some super-DLAs, we estimate star formation rates from potential detections of Lyman-alpha emission. We discuss constraints on electron densities from C II*/C II and Si II*/Si II. The DLAs and sub-DLAs appear to have different metallicity vs. velocity dispersion relations. We also find that the super-DLAs may have somewhat narrower velocity dispersions than the less gas-rich DLAs, and may arise in cooler/ less turbulent gas.

Murphy,Sessioned,Saint Michael's College; Swinburne University of Technology,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): <br />The first stars, known as population III, produced the first heavy elements, thereby enriching their surrounding pristine gas. However, previous detections of metals in intergalactic gas clouds find a heavy element enrichment 1/1000 to ∼ 1 times that of the solar environment, which is higher than expected for population III remnants. Here, we report the discovery of a Lyman limit system at redshift 3.53 with the lowest metallicity seen in gas with discernable metals, 10^(−3.44±0.24) times the solar value. The carbon-to-silicon abundance ratio is 10^(−0.21±0.16) times the solar value, and the metals are offset in velocity by 6 to 10 km/s from the bulk of the hydrogen. These properties are all consistent with enrichment by a population III star formation event. A recent enrichment scenario by population II stars cannot be ruled out, but the large cloud size (> 30 kpc) suggests it is not part of a cold accretion stream, and the 400 km/s velocity width of the system suggests it is not in a low-mass halo. Relative abundance measurements in this near-pristine regime open a new avenue for testing models of early gas enrichment and metal mixing.\n",10,

These violent explosions produce relativistic jets in a short burst of prompt emission and are followed by an afterglow emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum. During the afterglow, there are periods of sporadic increase in the X-ray flux, known as flares. Only ~1/2 of all GRBs produce flares. We present a sample selection of the brightest isolated flares observed by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT). Using light curves from the XRT Team repository at the University of Leicester between 2005 and 2014, and our own light curve fits, the sample was filtered using a stringent set of criteria. We selected bursts that: 1) had a high peak flare flux to afterglow ratio, and/or 2) a high fluence (integrated flux). By further analyzing these flares, we will study the structure of flares, searching for the three components that have been seen in isolated prompt emission pulses: an initial small rapidly decaying pulse, followed by the main flare which then decays over time and is followed by another small but slower decaying pulse. Seeing a similar behavior in X-ray flares as we see in prompt pulses will inform models for the physics of relativistic shocks.\n",1,

From this set of 2-3 events, it was derived what should be the general properties of these events, without statistical validations.

We can confirm that this population is in general also faint in the prompt phase, albeit a few exceptions, and do not follow the Amati relation.  We have studied their intrinsic properties (spectral index, decay index, distance, luminosity, isotropic radiated energy and peak energy) to assess whether they belong to the same population than the brighter afterglow events. We can statistically validate the hypothesis previously done that these events belong to a population of nearby events, different from that of the general population of long gamma-ray bursts. Last, we notice that about 65% of the confirmed gamma-ray burst-supernova associations belong to this group of faint events. While this is probably due to a selection effect, we discuss its consequence (these supernova templates should not be used blindly on normal long gamma-ray bursts).<br />\n",2,

We review the literature on possible sources of correlated emission of GWs and radio transients, highlighting proposed mechanisms that lead to a short-duration, high-flux radio pulse originating from the merger of two neutron stars or from a superconducting cosmic string cusp. We discuss the detection prospects for each of these mechanisms by low-frequency dipole array instruments such as LWA1, the Low Frequency Array and the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that a broad range of models may be tested by searching for radio pulses that, when de-dispersed, are temporally and spatially coincident with a LIGO/Virgo GW trigger within a ∼30 s time window and ∼200–500 deg(2) sky region. We consider various possible observing strategies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Uniquely, for low-frequency radio arrays, dispersion can delay the radio pulse until after low-latency GW data analysis has identified and reported an event candidate, enabling a prompt radio signal to be captured by a deliberately targeted beam. If neutron star mergers do have detectable prompt radio emissions, a coincident search with the GW detector network and low-frequency radio arrays could increase the LIGO/Virgo effective search volume by up to a factor of ∼2. For some models, we also map the parameter space that may be constrained by non-detections.\n",5,

White,Sessioned,Gemini Observatory; Gemini Observatory,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): GMOS-S was upgraded with new Hamamatsu CCDs on June 2014, featuring an improved red sensitivity with respect to the previous detectors and significantly less fringing. Early after the commissioning, an issue was identified when observing in any of the binned readout modes, namely that saturated pixels produced a decrease of counts with respect to the bias level in neighboring pixels. This effect, also known as 'banding', spanned the entire width of the amplifier, and while it did not destroy information, it rendered data reduction very cumbersome. Making matters worse, due to the saturation of a bad column on amplifier number 5 (on CCD2, near the middle of the focal plane), it ended up affecting the entire amplifier for almost all exposures longer than a minute. A team of Gemini instrument scientists and engineers investigated the issue and identified the root cause of the problem as originated in the ARC controller video boards. After significant lab testing, it was verified that a newly available revision of the video boards would solve the problem, though modification of the software was required in order to be compatible with them. This work was performed during the last semester of 2014 and the first semester of 2015. The new video boards were installed and commissioned during August 2015. As of September 1st, the new boards are fully installed and integrated, and the 'banding' effect has been completely eliminated. A short period of time was devoted to the recharacterization of the detector system and the new values for the gains, read noise and full well capacity have been derived. As an added benefit, the full well was increased by ~ 10 percent with respect to the previous value. The GMOS-S new detectors are now operating normally in the Gemini observing queue, and performing at full capacity.\n",1,

This system uses a collection of position sensors between panels to determine the relative position of adjacent panels; each panel is mounted on a Stewart platform to allow motion control with six degrees of freedom, facilitating the alignment of the optical surface for the segmented primary and secondary mirrors. Alignments of the primary and secondary mirrors and the camera focal plane with respect to each other are performed utilizing a set of CCD cameras which image LEDs placed on the mirror panels to measure relative translation, and custom-built auto-collimators to measure relative tilt between the primary and secondary mirrors along the optical axis of the telescope. In this contribution we present the status of the development of the SC optical alignment system, soon to be materialized in a full-scale prototype SC medium-size telescope (pSCT) at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona.\n",2,

This poster is an opportunity to exchange ideas about how Gemini can improve your experience while working with the Observatory and present details about new avenues of post-observing support coming soon. We encourage your feedback at any time.<br />Shortly after its creation, the SUSD conducted a complete revision of the communication cycle between Gemini and its community of researchers. The cycle was then revisited from the perspective of an astronomer interested in using Gemini for their research. This exercise led to a series of proposed changes that are currently under development, and the implementation of a sub-selection is expected in 2016, including the following. (1) Email notifications: Gemini users will receive new forms of email communications that are more instructive and tailored to their program. The objective is to direct the users more efficiently toward the useful links and documentation all along the lifecycle of the program, from phaseII to after the data are completely reduced. (2) HelpDesk system: The HelpDesk will become more user-friendly and transparent. (3) Webpages: The organization of the Gemini webpages will be redesigned to optimize navigation; especially for anything regarding more critical periods likes phaseIs and phaseIIs. (4) Data Reduction User Forum: Following recommendations from Gemini users, new capabilities were added to the forum, like email notifications, and a voting system, in order to make it more practical. This forum's objective is to bring the Gemini community together to exchange their ideas, thoughts, questions and solutions about data reduction, a sort of Reddit, StackOverflow or Slashdot for Gemini data.\n",3,

Choi*,J. Choi*,Sessioned,Dankook University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Non-interferometer phase-differential imaging method for direct imaging of the astronomical objects will be presented. The feasibility of non-interferometry method to retrieve the phase differential images of the astronomical objects is demonstrated in the laboratory experiments exploiting the two-dimensional Foucault knife-edge filtering method which is installed on a single telescope. The experiment setup is essentially analogous to the Schlieren imaging apparatus that can be taken images using an incoherent light source. The fractional derivation filtering by the two-dimensional knife-edge filter is developed in order to acquire the phase information of the object. The intensities of filtering images by the 2D knife-edge at several points along the optical axis of the telescope are substituted in the transport-intensity equation to obtain phase-differential images of the astronomical objects. Then the phase-differential images are obtained by two image intensities taken along the optical axis. In our experiment, a mono-directional scanning scheme of the 2DFK was exploited to reduce number of scan as well as increase the spatial resolution of images. An illuminated light out of a bundle of optical fibers as an artificial astronomical object is used our laboratory based experiment. The light from the each optical fibers in the fiber bundle that intensities have exiguously different or barely visible are represented the brightness of the astronomical objects. The experiment result, the phase contrast images, shows that barely identified object from an intensity based image has rendered almost equivalent contrast as the bright object. It represents that our proposed method can be recovered from phase difference of the object light that could not be identified from the intensity of objects brightness. The proposed method has a feature of render phase-differential images as well as compensates atmospheric turbulence with the setup mounting on a single-telescope. The presentation will be described the scheme of the non-interferometer phase-differential imaging and the image recovery process for the astronomical applications.\n",4,

The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next major international project in the field, scheduled for first observations in 2018. However, as with any telescope, CTA will have a finite field of view and limited number of observing hours per year. The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate that it is possible to build a relatively low cost (~$50,000) telescope, complimentary to the capabilities of CTA, capable of studying VHE (>1TeV) gamma rays. Over the course of the summer the mounting and pointing systems for a prototype imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope will be completed. This will involve both hardware additions to the system and the development of a software program to control pointing and tracking. Ultimately, the prototype telescope will be installed at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory, and will be integrated with the components developed by external collaborators.\n",6,

Accurate measurements in this energy range are critical for answering a broad range of astrophysical questions, but they are particularly challenging because this range encompasses the Compton scattering/pairproduction transition zone (~10 MeV) where the interaction cross section is minimized. These interaction processes require different optimizations in both detection and event reconstruction. We are developing a MIDEX-scale wide-aperture discovery mission, Compton-Pair Production Space Telescope (ComPair), to investigate the energy range from 200 keV to >500 MeV with high energy and angular resolution and with sensitivity approaching a factor of 20-50 better than COMPTEL. This instrument will be capable of measuring both Compton-scattering events at lower energy and pair-production events at higher energy. ComPair will build on the heritage of successful space missions including Fermi-LAT, CGRO, INTEGRAL, AGILE, AMS and PAMELA, and will utilize well-developed space-qualified detector technologies including Si-strip and CdZnTe-strip detectors, heavy inorganic scintillators, and plastic scintillators.\n",7,

The recent research in the field of space debris, demonstrated how it is possible to increase the effectiveness of optical measurements exploitation by using joint observations of the same target from different sites.<br />The University of Rome “La Sapienza”, in collaboration with Italian Space Agency (ASI), is developing a scientific network of observatories dedicated to Space Debris deployed in Italy (<i>S5Scope</i> at Rome and <i>SPADE</i> at Matera) and in Kenya at the Broglio Space Center in Malindi (<i>EQUO</i>). ASI founded a program dedicated to space debris, in order to spread the Italian capability to deal with different aspects of this issue. In this framework, the University of Rome is in charge of coordinating the observatories network both in the operation scheduling and in the data analysis. This work describes the features of the observatories dedicated to space debris observation, highlighting their capabilities and detailing their instrumentation. Moreover, the main features of the scheduler under development, devoted to harmonizing the operations of the network, will be shown.

Lizano,Sessioned,Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We model the vertical structure of magnetized accretion disks subject to viscous and resistive heating, and irradiation by the central star. We apply our formalism to the radial structure of magnetized accretion disks threaded by a poloidal magnetic field dragged during the process of star formation developed by Shu and coworkers. We consider disks around low mass protostars, T Tauri, and FU Orionis stars. We consider two levels of disk magnetization, λ<sub>sys</sub> = 4 (strongly magnetized disks), and λ<sub>sys</sub> = 12 (weakly magnetized disks). The rotation rates of strongly magnetized disks have large deviations from Keplerian rotation. In these models, resistive heating dominates the thermal structure for the FU Ori disk. The T Tauri disk is very thin and cold because it is strongly compressed by magnetic pressure; it may be too thin compared with observations. Instead, in the weakly magnetized disks, rotation velocities are close to Keplerian, and resistive heating is always less than 7% of the viscous heating. In these models, the T Tauri disk has a larger aspect ratio, consistent with that inferred from observations. All the disks have spatially extended hot atmospheres where the irradiation flux is absorbed, although most of the mass (~ 90 - 95 %) is in the disk midplane.\n",4,

Weaver*,I. Weaver*; A. Lopez; P. Macias,Sessioned,UC Santa Cruz,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter orbiting dangerously close to its parent star WASP-12 at a radius 1/44th the distance between the Earth and the Sun, or roughly 16 times closer than Mercury.  WASP-12’s gravitational influence at this incredibly close proximity generates tidal forces on WASP-12b that distort the planet into an egg-like shape.  As a result, the planet’s surface overflows its Roche lobe through L1, transferring mass to the host star at a rate of 270 million metric tonnes per second. This mass transferring stream forms an accretion disk that transits the parent star, which aids sensitive instruments, such as the Kepler spacecraft, whose role is to examine the periodic dimming of main sequence stars in order to detect ones with orbiting planets.  The quasi-ballistic stream trajectory is approximated by that of a massless point particle released from analogous initial conditions in 2D.  The particle dynamics are shown to deviate negligibly across a broad range of initial conditions, indicating applicability of our model to “WASP-like” systems in general.  We then apply a comprehensive fluid treatment by way of hydrodynamical code FLASH in order to directly model the behavior of mass transfer in a non-inertial reference frame and subsequent disk formation. We hope to employ this model to generate virtual spectroscopic signatures and compare them against collected light curve data from the Hubble Space Telescope’s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS).\n",5,

Here we report optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source  (ULS) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1) showing blueshifted broad Hα emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. The time variable jets have projected velocities ~17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem similar to those in the prototype microquasar SS 433. Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs, but an origin from a black hole or neutron star in M81 ULS-1 is hard to reconcile with its constant soft X-rays. The completely unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges the canonical theories for jet formation, but can be explained by a long speculated super-critically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows.\n",1,

Microlensing magnification, caused primarily by stars and white dwarfs close to the line of sight towards the lensed quasar images, is seen as uncorrelated flux variations due to the relative motions of the quasar, the lens, its stars, and the observer, and it depends on the structural and dynamical properties of the source and the lens. Since the magnification depends upon the size of the source, we can use microlensing to measure the size of quasar emission regions. In essence, the amplitude of the microlensing variability encodes the source size, with smaller sources showing larger variability amplitudes. Using state of the art microlensing techniques, our team has performed pioneering research in the field based on multi-wavelength space and ground-based observations. Among the most remarkable results, using Chandra observations we have set the first quantitative constraints on the sizes of the X-ray emission regions of quasars. In this work l briefly describe the methodology, the results from our previous multi-wavelength monitoring programs, and the next frontier of exploring the dependence of the structure of the X-ray emission regions on black hole mass and X-ray energy.\n",2,

Understanding the ISM is important for many areas of astrophysics, such as galactic dynamics, the chemical evolution of the galaxy, and the identification of timing noise in the search for gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays. Low frequency observations of pulsars are key, because the strength of propagation effects scales strongly with frequency.<br /><br />We present the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) as a key science tool for making high quality observations of pulsars at low frequencies (~80-300 MHz). Recently commissioned software for making tied-array beams and the MWA's high time resolution voltage capture system (VCS) allow an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity, vital for pulsar and other time-domain science. A pipeline has now been developed for observing the scintillation patterns of important pulsars at low frequencies, including a new computational technique for measuring the curvature of parabolic arcs in noisy secondary spectra. A program of MWA observations is being undertaken to sample a large number of millisecond pulsars. We present recent highlights including PSR J0437-4715, which yielded a new measurement of scattering screen distance of ~120 pc from Earth, consistent with a Parkes observation at ~730 MHz, and matching the predicted perimeter of the Local Bubble.\n",3,

Our study includes predictions from a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM) as well as observations from the COLDGASS, Bluedisk, and GAMA surveys. Using a simple toy model we demonstrate that, in the absence of a correlation between gas fraction and galaxy size, we would expect more compact disks to live 'high' on the SFMS, and vice versa, due to the observational Kennicutt relation. We demonstrate that this correlation is not seen in the observations, nor is it predicted by the SAM. We find in both the model and the observations that extended disks have a higher fraction of their baryonic mass in total cold gas and in HI and $H_{2}$ gas separately, offsetting the dependence of SFR on disk size. We investigate the origin of the gas fraction-size correlation in the SAMs, and find that it is connected with the rate of cosmological accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium.\n",2,

France,Sessioned,University of Colorado - Boulder,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Probing the surviving molecular gas within the inner regions of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) around T Tauri stars (1 – 10 Myr) provides insight into the conditions in which planet formation and migration occurs while the gas disk is still present. Recent studies done by Hoadley et al. 2015 and Banzatti & Pontipoddan 2015 suggest that gas in the inner disks of PPDs appear to “respond” to the loss of small dust grains with evolving PPD stage, and IR-CO emission may either be thermally or photo-excited by stellar UV radiation, depending on PPD evolutionary stage. Because far-UV H2 emission lines are dominantly photo-excited by stellar HI-Lyman alpha photons, we observe H2 absorption features against the stellar Lyman alpha wings in a large sample of PPDs at various evolutionary stages. We aim to characterize whether the inner disk H2 environment is in thermal equilibrium at various stages of PPD evolution. We use a sophisticated first-principles approach to fitting multiple absorption features along the red- and blue-wings of the observed stellar Lyman alpha profiles to extract column density estimates of H2 along the line of sight to the target. We find that the high kinetic energy H2 observed in absorption against the LyA wing may be described as a part of the thermal distribution with high kinetic temperature – a potential indication of an inner disk molecular hazy “envelope” around the cooler bulk disk. Ongoing research may help determine the state of the gas and whether it evolves with disk evolutionary stage.\n",4,

Around T Tauri stars, the size of this disk hole is expected to be on a 0.1-AU scale that is unresolved by current adaptive optics imaging, though some model-dependent constraints have been obtained by near-infrared interferometry. Here we report the first measurement of the inner disk wall around a solar-mass young stellar object, YLW 16B in the ρ Ophiuchi star-forming region, by detecting the light travel time of the variable radiation from the stellar surface to the disk. Consistent time lags were detected on two nights, when the time series in H and K bands were synchronized while the 4.5 μm emission lagged by 74.5±3.2 seconds. Considering the nearly edge-on geometry of the disk, the inner rim should be 0.084±0.004 AU from the protostar on average. This size is likely larger than the range of magnetospheric truncations, but consistent with an optically and geometrically thick disk front at the dust sublimation radius at ~1500 K. The detection of a definite time lag places new constraints on the geometry of the disk.\n",5,

Song,Sessioned,The University of Georgia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Hyades, a 750 Myr-old open cluster, has actively been examined due to its proximity (~50pc) and the large number of its members. The proximity enables us to identify very low-mass members of the cluster. For the member identification, the candidate star’s kinematics, age, and metallicity should match to those of the bona fide members of the cluster. In this research, we searched for candidate members of Hyades cluster using a tool developed for calculating membership probability based on the Bayesian approach. Using two hypotheses, Hyades and field star, this algorithm computed probabilities for stars to be either Hyades members or field stars. In order to check the reliability of this algorithm, we tested it to 250 bona fide Hyades members; the algorithm successfully identified 99% of members at probability of > 95%. We first select kinematic candidates marginalizing over distances and radial velocities. We applied this algorithm to URAT1 catalogue stars in the range of 3h 20m < R.A. < 5h 20m and 0 deg < Dec. < +30 deg. Since most early-type members must have been discovered already, we focused on late-type members with m_{R} > 9.0. Because most of these late-type candidate members lack trigonometric distance measurements, using SED fitting and theoretical isochrone models, we computed SED distance for each star. Then, the membership probability was re-calculated including the SED distance. To select the final list of candidate members, stars with high membership probability and SED distance of < 100pc were kept. For reducing false positive, we excluded stars in old sequence using GALEX UV data. To confirm the true membership of the candidate members, we began to obtain high spectral resolution spectra to confirm their radial velocity and metallicity. Here, we present the sequence of candidate selection and its results.\n",2,

An important way to measure the impact of merging is to study close pairs of nearly equal-mass galaxies. We do this by using data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and the SDSS to measure the evolution between redshifts 0≤z≤3 of massive (stellar masses M<sub>host</sub>>2E10 M<sub>sun</sub>) galaxies that are involved in major (1≤M<sub>host</sub>/M<sub>comp</sub>≤4), close (≤50 kpc separation) pairs. Our preliminary results are based on data from two of the legacy fields: UDS and GOODS-S. If we simply define major pairs based on H-Band flux ratios and corrected for line-of-sight contamination, we find that the fraction of massive galaxies in such pairs increases from 2-5% (z~0) to 20-45% (z~3), in agreement with a broad range of previous studies. In contrast, when we consider stellar mass ratios and attempt to account for close redshift proximity using the best available redshifts (either spectroscopic or photometric), the pair fraction and fraction of galaxies in pairs each follow a broken redshift dependence where there is an increase (~(1+z)<sup>2 </sup>) from z~0 to z~1, followed by a decreasing (~(1+z)<sup>-1.1</sup>) redshift dependence to z~3.

Using halo abundance matching over the redshift range 5 < z < 8 and an analytic prescription of gas accretion, we develop a model for the star formation efficiency f<sub>*</sub> of dark matter halos at z > 6 that matches the measured galaxy luminosity functions at these redshifts. We find that the star formation efficiency peaks near ∼ 10% at halo masses M ∼ 10<sup>11</sup>–10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, in qualitative agreement with its behavior at lower redshifts. Recent lensing observations of z ∼ 7 galaxies suggest that the efficiency declines toward smaller masses, with f<sub>*</sub> proportional to M<sup>1/2</sup> down to M ∼ 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> as expected by models of stellar feedback, albeit with large uncertainties. We then investigate the cosmic star formation histories and the corresponding models of cosmic reionization for a range of extrapolations to small halo masses. We compare these to a variety of observations, using them to further constrain the characteristics of the galaxy populations. Our approach provides an empirically-calibrated, physically-motivated model for the properties of star-forming galaxies sourcing the epoch of reionization. By modeling the redshift evolution of f<sub>*</sub>, we find a generally slower evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density compared to that predicted by f<sub>*</sub> fixed in time. In the case where star formation in low-mass halos is maximally efficient, an average escape fraction ∼ 0.1 can reproduce the CMB optical depth observed by Planck, whereas less efficient star formation in these halos requires about twice as many UV photons to escape, or an escape fraction that increases towards higher redshifts. Our models also predict how future observations with JWST can improve our understanding of these galaxy populations.\n",3,

We find that the ‘two-phase’ picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation – namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times 10<sup>11</sup> Msun is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts.

At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the centers of younger halos exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than disk-like galaxies and those formed in older halos.

The observation that water and hydroxyl megamasers rarely coexist in the same galaxy has given rise to a hypothesis that the two species appear in different phases of nuclear activity. The detection of simultaneous hydroxyl and water megamaser emission toward IC694 has called this hypothesis into question but, because many megamasers have not been surveyed for emission in the other molecule, it remains unclear whether IC694 occupies a narrow phase of galaxy evolution or whether the relationship between megamaser species and galactic processes is more complicated than previously believed. In this paper, we present results of a systematic search for 22 GHz water maser emission among OH megamaser hosts to identify additional objects hosting both megamaser. Our work roughly doubles the number of galaxies searched for emission in both molecules which host at least one confirmed maser. We confirm a definitive (>8σ) detection of water emission toward IIZw96, firmly establishing it as the second object to co-host both water and hydroxyl megamasers after IC694. We find high luminosity, narrow features in the water feature in IIZw96. All dual megamaser candidates appear in merging galaxy systems suggestive that megamaser coexistance may signal a brief phase along the merger sequence. A statistical analysis of the results of our observations provide possible evidence for an exclusion of H2O kilomasers among OH megamaser hosts.\n",7,

With 50% of the stellar mass in today's galaxies having formed before z~1 (Dickinson et al. 2003) and the cosmic star formation density peaking between 1 < z < 3 (Madau & Dickinson 2014), the epoch at z>3 is particularly important for understanding the rise of the Hubble sequence at later times. We present multi-wavelength photometry from the the unprecedentedly large 28 deg<sup>2</sup> Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) / Spitzer-HETDEX Exploratory Large Area (SHELA) survey in a study of 800,000 galaxies at redshifts of 1.9 to 3.5 including significant numbers of the most massive and most rare galaxies, unseen in pencil-beam deep field surveys. We use ugriz photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and fit galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population spectral templates to select LBGs at z~3-4 and measure the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function. Our survey's large area and moderate depth provide a unique view of the bright-end (M<sub>AB</sub><-22). Contamination by stellar sources or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be ruled out by the inclusion of multi-wavelength data. Probing a volume of 0.5 Gpc<sup>3</sup> at 1.9 < z < 3.5, similar to that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at z < 0.5, we provide the most definitive constraints for numerical models of cosmic galaxy evolution, expanding our knowledge of galaxy growth during this critical era in cosmic history.\n",8,

Our results indicate that early type galaxies in the current epoch are rarely powerful AGNs, with P < 10<sup>22</sup> WHz<sup>–1</sup> for a majority of the galaxies. Only massive galaxies are capable of hosting powerful radio sources while less massive galaxies are hosts to lower radio power sources.

There is a nearly equal fraction of star forming galaxies in radio faint (P < 10<sup>22</sup> WHz<sup>–1</sup>) and radio bright galaxies (P ≥ 10<sup>22</sup> WHz<sup>–1</sup>) suggesting that both star formation and radio mode feedback are constrained to be very low in our sample.

We include only those groups with sufficient completeness, ensuring that the most massive galaxy (MMG) has been observed spectroscopically. The position and dominance of the MMGs in their host groups is explored, basic properties of the MMGs are compared to those of control samples of satellites and field galaxies at similar stellar mass and redshift, and correlations of MMG properties with host group properties examined. While many MMGs are projected to lie close to the luminosity-weighted center, a broad range in the stellar mass fraction is found with some MMGs containing a large fraction of the total group stellar mass while others are not at all dominant. Compared to central group galaxies in the local universe, the SSFR of the MMG in similar mass systems is found to be significantly higher. Star formation rates, morphologies, and mass fractions of the MMGs are also compared to control samples of non-MMG galaxies with similar stellar mass and redshift. While MMGs and satellite galaxies have SSFRs that agree at the 40% level, MMGs definitely do not come from the same distribution as field galaxies. As a function of stellar mass, the fraction of passive galaxies for both MMGs and satellites is systematically higher than the field. We cannot however confirm that, at the same stellar mass, MMGs are more quenched than satellites, as has been found in the local universe. 19 GEEC MMGs were imaged with HST-ACS and many show significant disk components, but the sample is too small to conclude whether or not the MMG morphologies are the same as stellar and redshift matched control samples of satellite and field galaxies. Finally, we search for correlation of MMG and global group properties, including group masses and dynamics. Thus far MMG properties appear to be only weakly correlated with the properties of the groups they inhabit in this redshift regime.\n",11,

We must therefore rely on methods of estimation based on the observable effects that H<sub>2</sub> density has on other molecules. One such effect is the excitation of CO through collisions with H<sub>2</sub>, which is imprinted in the relative populations between CO rotational levels. Spectroscopic observations were made along 17 sight lines targeting ro-vibrational transitions out of the 0 ≤ <i>J</i> ≤ 6 levels in the fundamental band of CO. These absorption features were analyzed to determine level-specific CO column densities, allowing us to express the relative populations between adjacent energy levels as excitation temperatures. By utilizing the analysis of Goldsmith (2013), which relates H<sub>2</sub> density to CO excitation temperatures, we inferred upper and lower limits on the H<sub>2</sub> density in several clouds. Many of our results are consistent with those found by Goldsmith (2013) and suggest sight lines probing diffuse molecular clouds (<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>) ≈ 10 – 10<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>), although some likely sample denser material (<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>) ≥ 10<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>).

We show that young dust bands retain information on the size distribution and cross-sectional area of dust released in the original asteroid disruption, before it is lost to orbital and collisional decay. We find that the Emilkowalski cluster is the source of this partial band and that the dust released in the disruption would correspond to a regolith layer ∼3 m deep on the ∼10 km diameter source body’s surface. The dust in this band is described by a cumulative size-distribution inverse power-law index with a lower bound of 2.1 (implying domination of cross- sectional area by small particles) for dust particles with diameters ranging from a few μm up to a few cm. The coadded observations show that the thermal emission of the dust band structure is dominated by large (mm–cm size) particles. We find that dust particle ejection velocities need to be a few times the escape velocity of the Emilkowalski cluster source body to provide a good fit to the inclination dispersion of the observations. We discuss the implications that such a significant release of material, during the disruption of an asteroid, has for the temporal evolution of the structure, composition, and magnitude of the zodiacal cloud. Using the highly sensitive Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) dataset, we can now search for more of these faint signatures of very recent small body disruptions. Starting with the constraints on the amount and size distribution of the dust released in an asteroid catastrophic disruption, we can extrapolate to determine how small body disruptions would appear in extra solar debris disk systems.\n",9,

Our previous study of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies show that roughly 1/3 of the AGN possess kinematics with distinct signatures of outflows, therefore a lack of outflows within a similar population of AGN at higher redshifts strongly questions the importance of quasar-mode feedback on galaxy evolution.

In order to better understand feedback and the physical conditions of the outflowing gas, observational constraints on absorber kinematics and energetics are needed. We are utilizing multiple epoch, rest frame UV quasar spectra to establish limits on outflow locations and total column densities for the purpose of estimating wind kinetic energies and momenta. We are also investigating the variability patterns of broad absorption lines (BALs) and mini-BALs across a range of ionization states to probe underlying connections between the various classes of absorbers. This work employs observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hobby Eberly Telescope, and MDM observatory. We detect BAL variability in 3 out of 12 FeLoBAL quasars over multiple year timescales and conclude that the variable absorbers lie within tens of parsecs of the SMBH based on interpretations of the Fe II and Mg II BALS. We also measure significant BAL changes across daily to yearly timescales in a sample of 71 quasars with plausible detections of the P V 1117,1128 BAL. Detecting phosphorus in absorption is notable because it traces high column density outflows and is therefore relevant for studying AGN feedback.

Rodriguez Hidalgo,Sessioned,University of Florida - Gainesville; Tel-Aviv University; Ohio University; York University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Accretion disk outflows are important for galaxy evolution and an integral part of the quasar phenomenon, but they remain poorly understood. In order to construct a more complete picture of the quasar phenomenon, we need to understand the full range of different types of quasar outflows and how they correlate with one another. We examine seven SDSS quasars with CIV 1548,1551 Å outflow lines that span a range from strong BALs to weak mini-BALs. They have moderate redshifts (1.68 < z < 1.91) to minimize contamination from the Lyα forest while still allowing measurements of CIV from the ground and other important lines like OVI 1031,1038 Å and PV 1118,1128 Å with HST. We use archival SDSS and BOSS spectra in combination with HST COS G230L observations and multi-epoch ground-based spectra obtained at the MDM and Kitt Peak observatories to measure a variety of ions across the rest UV wavelength range. Our preliminary analysis shows OVI is present and stronger than CIV in all seven quasars. In one case, we detect an OVI mini-BAL with no accompanying CIV, requiring a highly-ionized outflow. In the strongest BAL quasar, we detect resolved PV doublet absorption that requires PV optical depths > 3 and in outflow gas with a line-of-sight covering fraction of only 0.27. Thus, the total column density in this outflow component might exceed N_H > 10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2 </sup>which has important consequences for the outflow kinetic energies and feedback. The multi-epoch CIV data reveal CIV outflow variability in all seven quasars; four become weaker, one becomes stronger, and two become both stronger and weaker over the different epochs. This variability happens across time scales of ~1-12 years in the quasar rest frames which is consistent with outflow locations close to the central quasar engines. We use these and other results to constrain the ionization, column density, and location of the absorbers with the broader goals of understanding accretion physics, the integrated structure of quasar outflows, and the impact a quasar has on its host galaxy.\n",4,

Why is there dense gas at hundreds to thousands of Schwarzchild radii around all* accreting super-massive black holes?<br />I propose that dense cool clouds naturally form (Krolik et al. 1981) in the accretion disk winds of quasars and AGNs (Murray et al. 1995) before the wind reaches escape velocity. X-ray variability causes the gas to accumulate in the stable regions on the thermal equilibrium curve. These clouds have the density and temperature of BEL clouds. The narrow range of density at which the BEL clouds form in pressure equilibrium with the warm wind may explain the simple L<sup>1/2 </sup>scaling of BEL region radius. The clouds are self-shielding and can no longer accelerate; so they rain back on elliptical orbits. They are then destroyed by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as they move at Mach ~ 30 through the warm disk wind.

A. Devereux*,N. A. Devereux*,Sessioned,Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ.,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): High angular resolution spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed a remarkable population of galaxies hosting dwarf Seyfert nuclei with an unusually large broad-line region (BLR). These objects are remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the size of the BLR can, in some cases, rival those seen in the most luminous quasars. Secondly, the size of the BLR is not correlated with the central continuum luminosity, an observation that distinguishes them from their reverberating counterparts. Collectively, these early results suggest that non-reverberating dwarf Seyferts are a heterogeneous group and not simply scaled versions of each other. Careful inspection reveals broad H Balmer emission lines with single peaks, double peaks, and a combination of the two, suggesting that the broad emission lines are produced in kinematically distinct regions centered on the black hole (BH). Because the gravitational field strength is already known for these objects, by virtue of knowing their BH mass, the relationship between velocity and radius may be established, given a kinematic model for the BLR gas. In this way, one can determine the inner and outer radii of the BLRs by modeling the shape of their broad emission line profiles. In the present contribution, high quality spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph are used to constrain the size of the BLR in the dwarf Seyfert nuclei of M81, NGC 3998, NGC 4203, NGC 3227, NGC 4051, and NGC 3516.\n",6,

Sun*,A. Sun*,Sessioned,Princeton University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Feedback from Active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been proposed as an important quenching mechanism to suppress star formation in massive galaxies. We investigate the most direct form of AGN feedback - galactic outflows - in the most luminous obscured AGN (L>10^45 erg/s) from the SDSS sample in the nearby universe (z<0.2). Using ALMA and Magellan observations to target molecular and ionized outflows, we find that luminous AGN can impact the dynamics and phase of the galactic medium, and confirm the complex multi-phase and multi-scaled nature of the feedback phenomenon. In particular, we found that most of these luminous AGN hosts ionized outflows. The outflow size, velocity, and energetics correlate with the AGN luminosity, and can be very extended (r > 10 kpc) and fast (v > 1000 km/s) for the most luminous ones. I end with presenting a new technique to find extended ionized outflows using broadband imaging surveys, and to characterize their occurrence rate, morphology, size distribution, and their dependence on the AGN luminosity. This technique will open a new window for feedback studies in the era of large-scale optical imaging surveys, e.g., HSC and then LSST.\n",7,

Graham,Sessioned,Caltech; IIT; Bryn Mawr College; JPL,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Most new surveys spend an appreciable time in collecting data on which to train classifiers before they can be used on future observations from the same dataset. The result generating phase can start much earlier if the training could incorporate data accumulated from older surveys enhanced with a small set from the new survey. This is exactly what Domain Adaptation (DA) allows us to do. The main idea behind DAs can be summarized thus: if we have two classes of separable objects in some feature space of a Source survey (S), we can define a hyperplane to separate the two types. In a second Target survey (T), for the same features the hyperplane would be inclined differently. DA methods get the mapping between the two hyperplanes using a small fraction of data from the Target (T) survey and can then be used to predict the classes of the remaining majority of data in T. We discuss the parameters that need to be tuned, the difficulties involved, and ways to improve the results. <br /><br />As we move towards bigger, and deeper surveys, being able to use existing labelled information to conduct classification in future surveys will be more cost-effective and promote time efficiency as well. Starting with the light curve data of 50,000 periodic objects from Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we have applied domain adaptation techniques such as Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK) with Random forest classifier and Co-training for domain adaptation (CODA) to the CRTS data which has 35,000 points overlapping with Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), and 12,000 with Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR). The results suggest that domain adaptation is an area worth exploring as the knowledge between these surveys is transferable and the approaches to find the mappings between these surveys can be applied to the remaining data as well as for near future surveys such as CRTS-II, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to name a few at the optical wavelengths.\n",1,

Unlike the original Kepler mission, the loss of two reaction wheels requires K2 to point near the ecliptic plane. As a result, thousands of faint asteroids can be seen to pass through the target pixel masks that are downlinked to earth after each ~75-day observing campaign. I will show how these serendipitous observations of asteroids can be used to obtain lightcurves for faint (V>18) objects which are otherwise challenging to target from the ground. In particular, I will demonstrate that the data are well-suited to identify small asteroids with rotation periods near or below the ~2 hour ""spin barrier"". I will also highlight the K2 data of other solar system bodies for which dedicated pixel masks have been (or will be) downlinked, including Neptune, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter trojans, trans-Neptunian objects, and multiple comets including Siding Spring and Chiron.

Transient sources are seen in every band of the electromagnetic spectrum, from low radio frequencies to gamma-ray energies, and produced by nearby flare stars to cosmological gamma-ray bursts.<br />We have performed a transient survey of four different fields with the LOw Frequency Array (LOFAR) at 150 MHz. LOFAR is a new generation radio interferometer which is observing at very low radio frequencies, a so far relatively unexplored frequency domain for transient searches. No credible transients were detected in our survey, but we were able to set stringent upper limits on the transient surface density using three new statistical methods. We also calculated the transient surface density as a function of the timescale of the transients, and established that the upper limits we can set vary up to two orders of magnitude for different timescales.<br />We have explored the complex relation between flux density, timescale and transient surface density, and developed a simulation method to calculate the transient rate as a function of both the flux and the duration of transients for different shapes of their lightcurves and for a given observing strategy. This method is independent of the nature of transient sources, and the instrument or the frequency of the observations. Therefore, this provides a tool for transient surveys carried out by current and future observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n",3,

FAVA was designed to efficiently search for variable sources over a wide range of energies and timescales. Unlike a traditional likelihood analysis, the analysis performed by FAVA uses the mission averaged emission as a background, and is as such independent of any model for the diffuse gamma-ray emission.  This makes the FAVA analysis especially sensitive to variable sources in the Galactic plane. This analysis is also computationally inexpensive, allowing for blind searches for flux variations over the entire sky. We will present some of the interesting flares identified through this analysis, and highlight those that are typically missed through traditional analysis methods.

Here, we present the first two papers in a series of publications for SACS. In the first paper, we introduce our method and catalog of 22,563 point sources and 442 extended sources. We examine the number counts of the AGN and galaxy cluster populations. SACS provides excellent constraints on the AGN number counts at the bright end with negligible uncertainties due to cosmic variance, and these constraints are consistent with previous measurements. The depth and areal coverage of SACS is well suited for galaxy cluster surveys outside the local universe, reaching z ∼ 1 for massive clusters. In the second paper, we use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR8 data to study the 203 extended SACS sources that are located within the SDSS footprint. We search for galaxy over-densities in 3-D space using SDSS galaxies and their photometric redshifts near the Swift galaxy cluster candidates. We find 103 Swift clusters with a > 3σ over-density. The remaining targets are potentially located at higher redshifts and require deeper optical follow-up observations for confirmations as galaxy clusters. We present a series of cluster properties including the redshift, BCG magnitude, BCG-to-X-ray center offset, optical richness, X-ray luminosity and red sequences. We compare the observed redshift distribution of the sample with a theoretical model, and find that our sample is complete for z ≤ 0.3 and 80% complete for z ≤ 0.4, consistent with the survey depth of SDSS. We also match our SDSS confirmed Swift clusters to existing cluster catalogs, and find 42, 2 and 1 matches in optical, X-ray and SZ catalogs, respectively, so the majority of these clusters are new detections. These analysis results suggest that our Swift cluster selection algorithm presented in our first paper has yielded a statistically well-defined cluster sample for further studying cluster evolution and cosmology.\n",3,

Schneider,Sessioned,Carnegie Mellon University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Galaxy clusters are a rich source of information for examining fundamental astrophysical processes and cosmological parameters, however, employing clusters as cosmological probes requires accurate mass measurements derived from cluster observables.  We study dynamical mass measurements of galaxy clusters contaminated by interlopers, and show that a modern machine learning (ML) algorithm can predict masses by better than a factor of two compared to a standard scaling relation approach. We create a mock catalog from Multidark's publicly-available N-body MDPL1 simulation where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard approach, we use a power law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy line of sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. The presence of interlopers in the catalog produces a wide, flat fractional mass error distribution, with width = 2.13.  We employ the Support Distribution Machine (SDM) class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a factor-of-two improvement (width = 0.67).  Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to recover masses than even a scaling relation approach applied to uncontaminated clusters.  We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces the cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster observations to evaluate cosmological models.\n",5,

The Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) will observe many hundreds of square degrees, covering a large sample of galaxy clusters out to z = 0.5 based on their optical spectra (3500-5500 Å). The spectra will provide important measures of the clusters dynamics and may enable constraints on cosmological parameters, but only if the measurements provide accurate estimates of the total cluster masses. We have carried out a study to investigate the ability of HETDEX to recover accurate galaxy cluster masses over a wide range of masses and redshifts. We used a detailed mock galaxy catalog and present mock observations of two different scenarios: (1) We targeted individual galaxy clusters to investigate the recovery of parameters with such observations. (2) We created and evaluated a HETDEX-like selection ""function'' of galaxies over a similarly sized portion of the sky and use well adopted techniques to recover the dynamical properties, such as velocity dispersion and mass. Using both observing strategies, we produce cluster mass probability density functions P(X|M,z), which can be used to determine the probability that a galaxy cluster of given mass (M), located at redshift (z) determined using observable parameter (X). We then applied these probability functions to ten galaxy clusters selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR8 and the Chandra-XMM X-ray Cluster Survey at z=0.2-0.3, and observed by the HETDEX spectrograph prototype instrument (VIRUS-p). We measured spectroscopic redshifts and line-of-sight velocities of the galaxies in and around each cluster, derived a line-of-sight velocity dispersion, and inferred a dynamical mass for each cluster which ranges from (0.4-24) x 10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> (M<sub>200c</sub>).

Indicator two employs the diameter-magnitude relation for spirals in general, as a secondary indicator, offering ~20% precision.  The ruler-based indicator is the only indicator with <10% precision able to independently calibrate type Ia supernovae-based distances at cosmological distances.  The secondary-based indicator is the only indicator with 20% precision applicable to more galaxies than in current Tully-Fisher surveys.  The primary indicator gives researchers a new tool to confirm or refute if, as currently believed, universal expansion is accelerating.  The secondary indicator gives researchers a new path toward acquiring a more complete 3D picture of the local universe and potentially, because the majority of galaxies in the universe are spirals, the distant universe.\n",9,

Wolfgang*,A. Wolfgang*; L. Rogers; E. B. Ford; G. P. Laughlin,Sessioned,"University of California, Santa Cruz; The Pennsylvania State University; University of California, Berkeley","Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii between 1 and 4 R_Earth, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of planets in a size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Masses are an important physical property for these theoretical studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. Therefore, a key practical concern is how to most accurately map a measured sub-Neptune radius to a mass estimate given the existing observations. This issue is also highly relevant to devising the most efficient follow-up programs of future transiting exoplanet detection missions such as TESS. Here we present a probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which both accounts for the anticipated intrinsic dispersion in these planets' compositions and quantifies the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that M/M_Earth = 2.7 (R/R_Earth)^1.3 and a scatter in mass of 1.9 M_Earth is the ""best-fit"" probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (R_pl < 4 R_Earth; Wolfgang, Rogers, & Ford, in review). The probabilistic nature of this M-R relation has several advantages: not only does its use automatically account for a significant source of uncertainty in the comparison between planet formation theory and observation, but it can predict the yield of future transit missions' follow-up programs under the observed range of planet compositions at a given radius. We demonstrate the latter with TESS as a case study, building on Sullivan et al. 2015 to provide the RV semi-amplitude distribution predicted by this more general M-R relation and a more detailed treatment of the underlying planet population as derived from Kepler. The uncertainties in the predicted K distribution, which are driven by our derived spread of masses at a given radius, provide an additional consideration for choosing the best RV follow-up target selection strategy.\n",1,

On the theoretical side, we are able to make ab initio calculations that make predictions about the properties of exoplanets. However, in order to link these predictions with observations, we must construct a statistical census of exoplanet demographics over as broad a range of parameters as possible. Current constraints on exoplanet demographics are typically constructed using the results of individual surveys using a single detection technique, and thus are incomplete. The only way to derive a statistically-complete census that samples a wide region of exoplanet parameter space is to synthesize the results from surveys employing all of the different discovery methods at our disposal. I present the first studies to demonstrate that this is actually possible, and describe a (mostly) de-biased exoplanet census that is constructed from the synthesis of results from microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging surveys. I will also discuss future work that will include the results of transit surveys (in particular, Kepler discoveries) to complete the census of exoplanets in our Galaxy, and describe the application of this census to develop the most comprehensive, observationally-constrained models of planet formation and evolution that have been derived to date.\n",3,

With its broad sky coverage, GBM triggers and localizes more short GRBs than other active space missions, ~45 each year, with an estimate of <1-5 within the LIGO detection horizon. Combining GBM and LIGO localization uncertainty regions may provide a smaller target to look for the GW host. A joint GBM-LIGO detection increases the confidence in the GW detection and helps characterize the parameters of the merger. Offline searches for weak GRBs that fail to trigger onboard Fermi indicate that additional short GRBs can be detected in the GBM data.

Chevalier,Sessioned,University of Virginia,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): We consider a model for the long-duration, low-luminosity gamma-ray burst GRB 060218 that plausibly accounts for multiwavelength observations to day 20. The components of our model are: (1) a long-lived (t<sub>j</sub> ~ 3000 s) central engine and accompanying low-luminosity (L<sub>j</sub> ~ 10<sup>45</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup>), mildly relativistic jet; (2) a low-mass (~ 10<sup>-2</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>) envelope surrounding the progenitor star; and (3) a modest amount of dust (A<sub>V</sub> ~ 0.1) in the circumstellar or interstellar environment. Blackbody emission from the transparency radius in a low-power jet outflow can fit the prompt thermal X-ray emission, and the prompt nonthermal X-rays and γ-rays may be produced via Compton scattering of thermal photons from hot leptons in the jet interior or the external shocks. The later mildly relativistic phase of this outflow can produce the radio emission via synchrotron radiation from the forward shock. Meanwhile, interaction of the associated SN 2006aj with a circumstellar envelope extending to ~ 10<sup>13</sup> cm can explain the early optical peak. The X-ray afterglow can be interpreted as a light echo of the prompt emission from dust at ~ 30 pc. Our model is a plausible alternative to that of Nakar, who recently proposed shock breakout of a jet smothered by an extended envelope as the source of prompt emission. Both our results and Nakar's suggest that ultra-long bursts such as GRB 060218 and GRB 100316D may originate from unusual progenitors with extended circumstellar envelopes, and that a jet is necessary to decouple the prompt high-energy emission from the supernova.\n",3,

In short-scale magnetic turbulence, likely to be self-generated in relativistic shocks, a scattering mean free path (mfp) with a  momentum dependence mfp ∝ p<sup>2</sup> is expected. We show that, in addition to changing the scale of the shock precursor, nonlinear effects from efficient Fermi acceleration can increase the cosmic ray injection and acceleration efficiency, over that expected from Bohm diffusion, by significant factors. These effects are absent in parallel, non-relativistic shocks and do not appear in relativistic shocks unless nonlinear effects are self-consistently described. The changes in Fermi acceleration from a strong momentum dependent diffusion coefficient will translate to changes in the intensity and spectral shape of subsequent radiation and may have important applications to gamma-ray bursts and other phenomena involving relativistic shocks.\n",6,

We have improved the driving software to include the ability to self-calibrate pointing through the web API of astrometry.net, and data can be reduced automatically through command line use of the Muniwin program. The mount offers slew in declination and RA, and tracking at sidereal or other rates in RA. Our previous tests with a Nikon D5100 with standard lenses in the focal length range 50-200 mm, operating at f/4 to f/5, allowed detection of 12<sup>th</sup> magnitude stars with 30 second exposure under very dark skies. At 85 mm focal length, a field of 15° by 10° is imaged with 4928 by 3264 color pixels, and we have adopted an 85 mm fixed focal length f/1.4 lens (as used by Project Panoptes), which we expect will give a limited magnitude approaching 15. With a large field of view, deep limiting magnitude, low cost, and ease of construction and use, we feel that the Algolcam offers great possibilities in monitoring and finding changes in the sky. We have already applied it to variable star light curves, and with a suitable pipeline for detection of moving or varying objects, it offers great potential for analysis and discovery. The use of low cost cutting edge technology makes Algolcam particularly interesting for enhancing the advanced undergraduate learning experience in astronomy.\n",5,

Ground-based optical transient surveys, e.g., LSST, ZTF and ATLAS and space-based exoplanet, supernova, and lensing surveys such as TESS and WFIRST will join the Gaia all-sky astrometric survey in producing a flood of data that will enable leaps in our understanding of the universe. There is a critical need for further characterization of these discoveries through high angular resolution images, deeper images, spectra, or observations at different cadences or periods than the main surveys. Such follow-up characterization must be well matched to the particular surveys, and requires sufficient additional observing resources and time to cover the extensive number of targets.<br />We describe plans for the Rapid Transient Surveyor (RTS), a permanently mounted, rapid-response, high-cadence facility for follow-up characterization of transient objects on the U. of Hawai‘i 2.2-m telescope on Maunakea. RTS will comprise an improved robotic laser adaptive optics system, based on the prototype Robo-AO system (formerly at the Palomar 1.5-m and now at the Kitt Peak 2.2-m telescope), with simultaneous visible and near-infrared imagers as well as a near-infrared integral field spectrograph (R~100, λ = 850 – 1830 nm, 0.15″ spaxels, 8.7″×6.0″ FoV). RTS will achieve an acuity of ~0.07″ in visible wavelengths and < 0.16″ in the near infrared leading to an increase of the infrared point-source sensitivity against the sky background by a factor of ~9, crucial for efficient near-infrared spectroscopy.<br />RTS will allow us to map the dark matter distribution in the z < 0.1 local universe with ten times better accuracy and precision than previous experiments. ATLAS will discover several thousand SNIae per year, measuring SNIa peak brightness, and decline rates, while RTS will measure reddening by dust, confirm SN type and confirm redshifts of the host galaxies. This unique combination of automated detection and characterization of astrophysical transients during a sustained observing campaign will yield the necessary statistics to precisely map dark matter in the local universe.\n",6,

But the origin of the so-called dense-gas fraction – the amount of dense gas in a molecular cloud above a certain critical threshold – is unclear. In this study, we compare the dense gas fractions of two molecular clouds with very different rates of star formation: the Rosette and Maddalena.

A variety of processes could be responsible for this emission. Although many complete shock or PDR calculations of emission have been published, we know of no previous simple calculation that shows the emission spectrum and level populations of thermally excited low-density . We present a range of purely thermal collisional simulations, corresponding to constant gas kinetic temperature at different densities. We consider the cases where the collisions affecting H<sub>2</sub> are predominantly with atomic or molecular hydrogen. The resulting level population (often called “excitation”) diagrams show that excitation temperatures are sometimes lower than the gas kinetic temperature when the density is too low for the level populations to go to LTE. The atomic case goes to LTE at much lower densities than the molecular case due to larger collision rates. At low densities for the <i>v</i>=1 and 2 vibrational manifolds level populations are quasi-thermal, which could be misinterpreted as showing the gas is in LTE at high density. At low densities for the molecular case the level population diagrams are discontinuous between <i>v</i>=0 and 1 vibrational manifolds and between <i>v</i>=2, <i>J</i>=0, 1 and other higher <i>J</i> levels within the same vibrational manifold. These jumps could be used as density diagnostics. We show how much the H<sub>2</sub> mass would be underestimated using the 1-0 S(1) line strength if the density is below that required for LTE. We give diagnostic diagrams showing level populations over a range of density and temperature. The density where the level populations are given by a Boltzmann distribution relative to the total molecular abundance (required to get the correct H<sub>2</sub> mass), is shown for various cases. We discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of H<sub>2</sub> observations of the Crab Nebula and filaments in cool-core clusters of galaxies.\n",2,

RAMPS employs the K-band Focal Plane Array receiver on the NRAO Green Bank Telescope. The main goal of RAMPS is to characterize the Galactic population of dense star-forming molecular clumps by measuring the gas temperatures, column densities, radial velocities, and kinematic distances using the ammonia line ratios. I report results from the survey's first 6.4 square degrees and present large-scale NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) integrated intensity maps, gas temperature maps, and column density maps. To date over 500 clumps have been identified and characterized. In addition, RAMPS has now detected 619 water maser sites, most of which are detected for the first time.  Only 60% of the water masers are associated with detected ammonia emission. We have also discovered a remarkable star forming region with unusually broad NH<sub>3</sub> lines (ΔV ~ 25 km/s) and a very rare NH3 (3,3) shock-excited maser.

Charlton,Sessioned,The Pennsylvania State University; Inter-University Centre for Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is the most abundant molecule in the universe. It plays a crucial role in cooling and molecular chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM). The Lyman- and Warner-bands absorption of H<sub>2</sub> are detected in 10-20% of high-z Damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs). Due to the lack of far-UV (FUV) sensitive space based spectrograph in the past, H<sub>2</sub> has never been studied in low-z DLAs/sub-DLAs systematically. However, the unprecedented FUV sensitivity of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the HST has changed this scenario dramatically. Recently, we have conducted the first survey of H<sub>2</sub> in low-z DLAs/sub-DLAs in the public HST/COS archive and found that ~50% of them show H<sub>2</sub> absorption with <i>N</i>(H<sub>2</sub>) > 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. The H<sub>2</sub> incidence rate is, thus, >2 times higher at low-z. We argue that the increase of the cosmic mean metallicity of DLAs/sub-DLAs and the dimming of ambient radiation field due to the decrease of the cosmic star-formation rate density with redshift are responsible for such an enhanced H<sub>2</sub> detection rate at low-z. Simple photoionization models favor a radiation field much weaker than the mean Galactic ISM field and particle density in the range 10-100 cm<sup>-3</sup>. The large impact parameters of the identified host-galaxies suggest that the H<sub>2</sub> bearing gas is not related to star forming disks but stems from self-shielded, tidally stripped or ejected disk-material in the halo or from extended HI disk. Important results of our survey (see 2015MNRAS.448.2840M for details) will be summarized in the talk.\n",4,

Such PDF analysis has the potential to probe the physical processes that are controlling cloud structure and star formation activity. The chosen IRDC is of particular interest since it has almost 100,000 solar masses within a radius of 8 parsecs, making it one of the most massive, dense molecular structures known and is thus a potential site for the formation of a high-mass, “super star cluster”. We study mass surface densities in two ways. First, we use a combination of NIR, MIR and FIR extinction maps that are able to probe the bulk of the cloud structure that is not yet forming stars. This analysis also shows evidence for flattening of the IR extinction law as mass surface density increases, consistent with increasing grain size and/or growth of ice mantles. Second, we study the FIR and sub-mm dust continuum emission from the cloud, especially utlizing Herschel PACS and SPIRE images. We first subtract off the contribution of the foreground diffuse emission that contaminates these images. Next we examine the effects of background subtraction and choice of dust opacities on the derived mass surface density PDF. The final derived PDFs from both methods are compared, including also with other published studies of this cloud.

Gas-grain reactions require a substrate on which the reaction is able to occur. The formation of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the ISM is a prime example of a gas-grain reaction. In these reactions, an atom of hydrogen will strike a surface, adsorb to the surface, interact with the molecular structure of substrate (in this case water), form molecular hydrogen, and then be ejected from the surface. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hydrogen atoms sticking to an amorphous water-ice surface. This study examines the first step in the process; the sticking of the atom to the substrate. This talk emphasizes the importance of accurately defining a sticking event in calculating sticking probabilities which are used to obtain a reasonable model for H<sub>2</sub> formation in the ISM.

How does baryonic structure trace the underlying dark matter? How have galaxies evolved to produce the present day Universe?

Intensity mapping, which relies on the ability to detect many objects at once through their integrated emission rather than direct detection of individual objects, is a critical part of this mosaic.  In particular, our understanding of the molecular gas component of massive galaxies is being revolutionized by ALMA and EVLA but the population of smaller, star-forming galaxies, which provide the bulk of star formation cannot be individually probed by these instruments.<br /><br />In this talk, I will summarize two intensity mapping experiments to detect molecular gas through the carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transition.

Specifically, the 2-halo clustering signal on ~degree scales is sensitive to the luminosity function integral.<br /><br />TIME-Pilot is designed for a first measurement of EoR clustering via the 158-micron [CII] transition redshifted into the millimeter band. 32 waveguide spectrometers disperse the 183-326 GHz band (z=5.5-9 for [CII]) at resolving power of 100 to arrays totaling 1840 TES bolometers, all cooled to below 300 mK. TIME-Pilot will be deployed to the JCMT, and the survey volume will consist of an on-sky footprint of 1 degree (~150 cmlc) by 1 beam (~0.8 cMpc), with depth ~1200 cMpc provided by the spectral coverage. Our models indicate that the raw sensitivity of TIME-Pilot is sufficient to provide a detection of the [CII] clustering signal in a couple of hundred hours on sky. However, the dominant signal in the experiment will be the CO-emitting galaxies at z~0.5 to 3. This signal is interesting in its own right, but will need to be measured and removed to reveal the [CII].<br /><br />TIME-Pilot is also ideally suited to measure the kSZ effect due to peculiar velocities in galaxy clusters. While previous kSZ surveys have been limited by imperfect atmospheric subtraction, TIME-Pilot will use a unique atmospheric subtraction technique demonstrated with Z-Spec, in which the water vapor fluctuations are monitored via total power measurements at the spectrometer band edges, and removed from the science dataset. Finally, the instrument includes 11 broad-band 150-GHz photometers to measure the tSZ effect in the decrement. TIME-Pilot has a kSZ sensitivity of 500 km/s in an 8 hour observation, 5 times improved over previous experiments and sufficient to enable the first cosmological kSZ surveys.\n",7,

Such datasets provide context to galaxy evolution studies for the earliest galaxies on scales of tens of Mpc, but at present wide, deep galaxy surveys are lacking, and attaining the depth to survey the bulk of galaxies responsible for reionization will be challenging even for JWST.

Multi-year observations with Fermi/LAT using the ephemerides from RXTE reveal that B0540-69 is the most luminous gamma-ray pulsar ever detected. Its pulsed luminosity above 100 MeV is 5.7x10<sup>36</sup> erg/s, about 20 times brighter than the Crab Pulsar, the next brightest. The pulse profile in gamma rays is similar to that seen in X-rays and optical light; the giant radio pulses align with the shoulders of the high-energy profiles. The detection of B0540-69 in gamma rays offers a new look at particle acceleration and emission in the magnetospheres of very young pulsars. Unpulsed gamma-ray emission has also been detected from PSR J0537-6910, another young pulsar in the LMC. The two pulsars contribute most of the gamma-ray emission from the 30 Doradus nebula, indicating that cosmic rays contribute only a small part. Recent monitoring of B0540-69 with the Swift/XRT shows a large, sudden, and persistent increase in the spin-down rate of B0540-69. The relative increase in the spin-down rate of 36% is unprecedented for B0540-69. No accompanying change in the spin rate was seen, and no change was seen in the pulsed X-ray emission from B0540-69 following the change in the spin-down rate. Such large relative changes in the spin-down rate are seen in the recently discovered class of ``intermittent pulsars'', and we compare the properties of B0540-69 to such pulsars. We consider possible changes in the magnetosphere of the pulsar that could cause such a large change in the spin-down rate. These changes are likely to result in a new braking index for the pulsar. We report on continued monitoring with Swift/XRT to determine the new braking index and to detect a new state change, should it occur.\n",4,

The physics and structure of these disks are governed by a dynamo-like mechanism, which channels the accretion power liberated by the magnetorotational instability into an ordered toroidal magnetic field.  To study dynamo activity, we performed three-dimensional, stratified, isothermal, ideal magnetohydrodynamic shearing box simulations.  In our simulations, the strength of this self-sustained toroidal magnetic field depends on the net vertical magnetic flux we impose, which allows us to study weak-to-strong magnetization regimes.  We find that the entire disk develops into a magnetic pressure-dominated state for a sufficiently strong net vertical magnetic flux.  Over the two orders of magnitude in net vertical magnetic flux that we consider, the effective α-viscosity parameter scales as a power-law.  We quantify dynamo properties of toroidal magnetic flux production and its buoyant escape as a function of disk magnetization.  Finally, we compare our simulations to an analytic model for the vertical structure of strongly magnetized disks applicable to the high/soft state of X-ray binaries.\n",8,

Circumstantial evidence has been building of an extragalactic origin for FRBs, and real-time systems on single dish telescopes have enabled extensive follow-up of recent discoveries at other wavelengths. However, the single dishes that have discovered FRBs to date cannot sufficiently localize FRBs to tie them to a specific origin; they also are unable to accurately measure a flux density of FRBs.

Previous ALMA Cycle 0 12CO observation showed outflow cavities produced by the entrainment of ambient gas by the protostellar jet and wide-angle wind. Here we present analysis of observation of 12CO, 13CO, C18O and other species using combined 12m array and ACA observations. The improved angular resolution and sensitivity allow us to detect details of the outflow structure. Specially, we see that the outflow cavity wall is composed of two or more layers of outflowing gas, which separately connect to different shocked regions along the outflow axis inside the cavity, suggesting the outflow cavity wall is composed of multiple shells entrained by a series of jet bow-shock events. The new 13CO and C18O data also allow us to trace relatively denser and slower outflow material than that traced by the 12CO. These species are only detected within about 1 to 2 km/s from the cloud velocity, tracing the outflow to lower velocities than what is possible using only the 12CO emission. Interestingly, the cavity wall of the red lobe appears at very low outflow velocities (as low as ~0.2 km/s). In addition, 13CO and C18O allow us to correct for the CO optical depth, allowing us to obtain more accurate estimates of the outflow mass, momentum and kinetic energy. Applying the optical depth correction significantly increases the previous mass estimate by a factor of 14. The outflow kinetic energy distribution shows that even though the red lobe is mainly entrained by jet bow-shocks, most of the outflow energy is being deposited into the cloud at the base of the outflow cavity rather than around the heads of the bow shocks. The estimated total mass, momentum, and energy of the outflow indicate that the outflow has the ability to disperse the parent core. We found possible evidence for a slowly moving rotating outflow in CS. Our 13CO and C18O observations also trace a circumstellar envelope with both rotation and infall motions.\n",1,

We observed the filaments in NH<sub>3</sub> (1,1) & (2,2) and CCS 2<sub>1</sub>-1<sub>0</sub> with spectral resolution of 0.038 km/s and spatial resolution of 31"". The CSAR algorithm, which is a hybrid of seeded-watershed and binary dendrogram algorithm, identifies 39 leaves and 16 branches in NH3 (1,1). Applying a virial analysis for the 39 NH<sub>3</sub> leaves, we find only 9 out of 39 leaves are gravitationally bound, and 12 out of 30 gravitationally unbound leaves are pressure-confined. Our analysis suggests that a dense core may form as a pressure-confined structure, evolve to a gravitationally bound core, and then undergo collapse to form a protostar (Seo et al. 2015).<br /><br />We also present more realistic dynamic stability conditions for dense cores with converging motions and under the influence of radiation pressure. The critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere and the isothermal cylinder have been widely used to test stability of dense cores and filaments; however, these assume a quiescent environment while actual star forming regions are turbulent and illuminated by radiation. In a new analysis of stability conditions we account for converging motions which have been modeled toward starless cores (Seo et al. 2011) and the effect of radiation fields into account. We find that the critical size of a dense core having a homologous converging motion with its peak speed being the sound speed is roughly half of the critical size of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere (Seo et al. 2013). We also find that the critical mass/line density of a dense core/filament irradiated by radiation are considerably smaller than that of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere/isothermal cylinder when the radiation pressure is stronger than the central gas pressure of dense core/isothermal cylinder. For inner Galactic regions and regions near OB associations, the critical mass/line density of dense structure may be less than 20% of the critical mass/line density of Bonnor-Ebert sphere/isothermal cylinder (Seo et al., in prep.).\n",2,

We observe filamentary substructure in these sheet-like structures, which is commonly found in numerical simulations of supersonic turbulence. We find that the dense gas in the CLASSy region with the fewest young sources (the L1451 region of Perseus) is better characterized as a collection of distinct ellipsoidal structures than a contiguous region of flattened gas and dust. The lack of flattened, high-density structure in L1451 may indicate that this region of Perseus has not been strongly compressed by turbulent flows to create a sheet-like geometry and the strong density enhancement needed to efficiently form stars.\n",4,

Whether or not high-mass stars form in a similar way as low-mass stars can be tested by massive starless cores (MSCs), which are invoked as the initial condition in the Core Accretion model, but not in the Competitive Accretion model. We first searched for MSC candidates in the densest regions of Infrared Dark Clouds with the deuterated species N<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup>, which has been found to be one of the best tracers of the cold, dense conditions of low-mass pre-stellar cores. Two candidates (C1-N & S) were revealed by our ALMA Cycle 0 observation. In particular, C1-S has ~ 60 M⊙. Our dynamical study found that ~mG magnetic fields need to be present if the cores are virialized. Next we developed astrochemical modeling to understand how high levels of deuteration arise in these cores, especially tracking the deuteration fraction D<sub>frac</sub><sup>N2H+</sup>(≡ [N<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup>]/[N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>]), which can rise by several orders of magnitude above the cosmic [D]/[H] ratio. Our models show that high levels of D<sub>frac</sub><sup>N2H+ </sup>≥ 0.1 generally require at least several local free-fall times to be established under typical core conditions and this is the basis of a “deuteration clock” that can measure the chemical age and thus collapse rates of MSCs. We have begun work to implement the astrochemical network into full (M)HD simulations of these structures. A detailed observational study to measure [N<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup>], [N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>] and thus D<sub>frac</sub><sup>N2H+</sup><sup> </sup>in the C1-N and C1-S cores have been carried out, utilizing multi-transition data observed with ALMA, CARMA, SMA, JCMT, IRAM 30m and NRO 45m telescopes. We find high levels of D<sub>frac</sub><sup>N2H+</sup> ≈ 0.2 - 0.7. Comparing with the theoretical chemodynamical models indicates that C1-N and C1-S have been contracting at rates ~10 times slower than free-fall, which may be consistent with the presence of strong magnetic fields in the cores. Using ALMA, we have also extended our search for more MSCs, using N<sub>2</sub>D<sup>+</sup>(3-2) emission as our primary tracer. At least several promising candidates have been found that appear to be similar in their properties to C1-S, which may indicate massive starless cores are commonly involved in the massive star formation process.\n",5,

These advances include identifying and classifying the young protostellar population (Spitzer c2d and Gould Belt surveys) and the dense cores and larger filaments and clumps which form the cores and YSOs (Herschel and JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Surveys). The power of these legacy surveys lies in the large areal coverage and consistency in observing strategies between nearby molecular clouds. A major gap in the present data is a comparable survey to characterize the dense gas properties. Kinematics and gas temperatures are key to understanding the history and future fate of star-forming material, and these are not accessible from the primarily continuum-based measurements in the legacy surveys described above. We have begun an ambitious legacy survey for the GBT, the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS), to map NH<sub>3</sub> emission toward all the northern Gould Belt star forming regions where Av > 7. The Gould Belt is a ring of young stars and star-forming regions that contains nearly all the ongoing, predominantly low-mass star formation within 500 pc of the Sun. Here we present the initial results from the survey.\n",6,

We show that within the uncertainties, the ionization parameter, equivalent width (EW), EW versus specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relation, EW versus stellar mass relation, line-of-sight velocity dispersion, dynamical mass, and stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio are similar for filament and field star-forming galaxies. However, we show that on average, filament star-forming galaxies are more metal-enriched (~ 0.1-0.15 dex), possibly due to the inflow of the already enriched intrafilamentary gas into filament galaxies. Moreover, we show that electron densities are significantly lower (a factor of ~17) in filament star-forming systems compared to those in the field, possibly because of a longer star-formation timescale for filament star-forming galaxies. Our results highlight the potential pre-processing role of galaxy filaments and intermediate-density environments on the evolution of galaxies, which has been highly underestimated.\n",2,

Johnson,Sessioned,University of Oxford; Durham University,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS) aims to study the spatially-resolved dynamics, star formation and chemistry of ~1000 star-forming galaxies at z~1. Here we begin to probe the epoch of peak star formation in the universe, a key era for galaxy mass assembly. The primary causes of this increased star formation are hotly debated, as are the dominant mechanisms for mass growth (e.g. major mergers, secular evolution). It is thus essential to determine how the ratio of stellar, gaseous and dark mass in galaxies has varied over cosmic time, and whether this is related to the global fall of star formation activity over the same period. Using a simple arctan function to model the spatially-resolved Ha kinematics of the KROSS galaxies, and SED fitting to retrieve stellar masses, I present the observed and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) for sub-samples of the ~400 KROSS galaxies observed. I find a dependence of the KROSS TFRs on the relative importance of rotation and pressure support in galaxies (V/sigma). I explore reasons for the increased intrinsic scatter found in all relations in comparison to z~0. Considering only rotationally supported galaxies (V/sigma > 2.5), there is an apparent evolution of the zero-point of the TFR (-1.8 mag and 0.54 dex for the absolute K-band and stellar mass TFR respectively) since z~1. For a given dynamical mass, galaxies had less stellar mass at z~1 than today. The implications of this for galaxy evolution theory are discussed.<br /><br />Further, when comparing the KROSS TFRs to those at z~0 we must consider the systematic bias introduced as a result of the measurement methods used. To make a direct comparison it is essential to use the same observational and analytical methods. In practice, to compare to KROSS we must take IFU observations of z~0 galaxies and degrade the data to the same signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial and spectral resolution as that of the KROSS data. The degraded data must then be analysed in the same manner as with KROSS, at which point a direct comparison may be made. I discuss my work comparing the TFRs of KROSS and the SAMI Galaxy Survey in this manner and its implications on previous measures of the evolution of the TFR since z~1.\n",3,

Malhotra,Sessioned,NASA GSFC; UCLA; Arizona State,"Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): The [OIII]λ4363 nebular emission line, which provides the <i>most reliable determination of the gas metallicity</i> by measuring the electron temperature of the gas, is intrinsically weak. As such, most metallicity studies at both low and high redshifts have utilized ""strong-line"" metallicity calibrations, such as [NII]λ6583/Hα or R<sub>23</sub> = ([OII]+[OIII])/Hβ. However, there are growing concerns that these diagnostics may not be used for evolutionary studies due to differences in the physical conditions (e.g., density, ionization, abundance ratios) of the interstellar gas in galaxies. A clear demonstration for this concern is the offset on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagnostic diagram ([OIII]λ5007/Hβ vs. [NII]λ6583/Hα) for high-<i>z</i> star-forming galaxies from local star-forming galaxies.<br /><br />To examine this issue, we investigate the accuracy that commonly-used strong-line diagnostics can explain the direct oxygen abundances. Here, we use a sample of ~100 low-mass galaxies at <i>z</i>=0.07 to 1.0 with detections of the [OIII]λ4363 emission line from Keck and MMT optical spectroscopy. These galaxies are pre-selected for their strong nebular emission lines from the Subaru Deep Field and the DEEP2 Survey. Utilizing the optical emission lines, we argue that ""R<sub>23</sub>"" is not a reliable diagnostic and that discrepancies from [OIII]λ4363-based metallicity cannot be explained simply by higher gas densities or higher ionization parameter. We do find that the [NII]-based metallicity diagnostics of Pettini & Pagel (2004) are in agreement with [OIII]λ4363-based metallicity at <i>z</i>~0.5. There is, however, a sub-population (25%) where [NII]-based estimates are overestimating the oxygen metallicities. We argue that enhanced nitrogen abundances, relative to oxygen, is responsible for this significant (~0.5 dex) offset in metallicity. We present preliminary results for a revised metallicity calibration that considers the N/O abundance ratio.\n",4,

Key to understanding this process is a direct measurement of the distribution of star formation within galaxies at this crucial epoch. This is now possible with the WFC3 grism capability on HST, as it provides Hα maps of all galaxies at 0.7< z <1.5 in its field of view. Using Hα maps for 2727 galaxies, we show where star formation is distributed in galaxies across the star formation - mass plane (the “main sequence”). We find that the disk scale length of Hα is larger than that of the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. Across the main sequence, we find evidence for ‘coherent star formation’: in galaxies with higher than average star formation rates, Hα is enhanced throughout the disk; similarly, in galaxies with low star formation rates Hα is depressed throughout the disk. I discuss these results in the context of several proposed mechanisms for enhancing and quenching star formation. I also show first results of the spatial distribution of star formation at z~2-3.\n",5,

We combine the deep broad-band images of CANDELS and the high-resolution optical spectroscopy from Keck/DEIMOS surveys --- TKRS, DEEP2, DEEP3, and HALO7D --- to explore the star formation histories of low-mass galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.5≤z≤1.0). We study (1) the stellar mass (M)--gas-phase metallicity (Z) relation (MZR) and its scatter and (2) the ratio of star formation rates (SFRs) measured through FUV to that through Hβ (FUV--Hβ ratio). Our MZR sample is ∼20 times larger than those in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size enables superior constraints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime. We find that the scatter of the MZR increases as mass decreases. For the FUV--Hβ ratio, we find that it increases with the decrease of mass and SFR. Both results can be explained by low-mass galaxies having a star formation history with more bursts than massive galaxies having. A simple model shows that the star formation occuring in starburst phases in low-mass galaxies is 5x higher than that in a constant star formation phase, while, for massive galaxies, the bursty phases of star formation is negligible. Finally, we find that our median FUV--Hβ ratio for low-mass galaxies is higher than that of local galaxies of the same mass, implying a redshift evolution.\n",6,

Models of the expected shift in the color of the field BHB stars based on modern stellar evolutionary codes confirm that this color gradient can be associated with an age difference of roughly 2-2.5 Gyrs, with the oldest stars concentrated in the central ~15 kpc of the Galaxy. Within this central<br />region, which we refer to as the Ancient Chronographic Sphere (ACS), the age difference spans a mean color range of about 0.05 mag (~0.8 Gyrs). Interestingly, the ACS extends far enough to include the Solar Neighborhood, suggesting that ancient metal-poor stars should be readily detectable in the vicinity of the Sun. Furthermore, we show that chronographic maps can be used to identify individual substructures, such as the Sagittarius Stream, and overdensities in the direction of Virgo and Monoceros, based on the observed contrast in their mean BHB colors with respect to the foreground/background field population.<br /><br />We acknowledge partial support from the grant PHY 14-30152; Physics Frontier Center/JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE), awarded by the US National Science Foundation.\n",1,

We determine stellar masses to 0.07 dex from APOGEE DR12 spectra of red giants; these imply age estimates accurate to 0.2 dex (40 percent). THE CANNON constrains the ages foremost from spectral regions with particular absorption lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent dredge-up.

The high-resolution (R ~ 23,000), near infrared (<i>H</i>-band, 1.5-1.7 μm) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and [α/M]). Due to the smaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectra and accurate Hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate the stellar masses to within 40 %. For red giants, the relatively rapid evolution of stars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on the mass. We examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relation directly and a Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a constant SFH. To improve the prior on the SFH, we use a hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model SFH from the age probability distribution functions of the data. The results of an α-dependent Gaussian SFH model shows a clear relation between age and [α/M] at all ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical Bayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution function and determine ages for individual stars. The age-metallicity relation is flat, with a slight decrease in [M/H] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread in metallicity. For stars with ages > 1 Gyr we find a smaller spread, consistent with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on the older stars. This method of estimating ages of red giants is developed with the intent of estimating ages for the much larger sample of APOGEE survey giants that will have parallax measurements from Gaia.\n",5,
